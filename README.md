## Project Summary
A personal website and blog built with Astro.js, featuring a portfolio, blog posts (synced from Obsidian), interactive components, and custom documentation. The site serves as both a professional showcase and a platform for sharing technical knowledge.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Astro.js only, with Vue3 as exception for component interactivity
- **Styling**: Barebone TailwindCSS with custom semantic classes and Starwind (similar to shadcn/ui)
- **Additional Libraries for sketches only**: tone.js, pixi.js, three.js, canvas-sketch

→ *For detailed tech specs, see `src/content/docs/8-memory-bank/05-tech-context.md`*

## Features

### Content Types
1. **Personal Website**: Landing page, portfolio, resume, and contact information
2. **Blog**: Journal entries and posts synced from Obsidian
3. **Sketches & Experiments**: Documentation of creative-coding and web-dev practices
4. **Documentation System**: Project workflow and development best practices

### Key Features

#### Obsidian Notes Integration
- Custom sync scripts using `rsync` to maintain content between Obsidian and the website
- Benefits:
  - Single source of truth for project documentation
  - Seamless editing within Obsidian.md
  - Easy content migration between projects
  - Automatic sync of latest files

#### Generative Thumbnails
- Automatic OG image generation for blog posts and sketches
- SVG-based generation with format priority system
- Implements file-based caching for improved build performance
- Components: 
  - Image Generator Utility (`src/utils/og-image-generator.js`)
  - Build-time Generation Script (`scripts/generate-og-images.mjs`)
  - Layout Components (`src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro`)

#### Component System
- Reusable component architecture using Starwind
- Example: CardComponent for consistent, customizable card designs
- Dark mode support via `ThemeToggle.astro`
