Written during the Qing dynasty by scholar Li Yuxiu, this classic text draws from the teachings of Confucius, emphasizing the importance of moral character, filial piety, and lifelong learning. With its concise three-character verses, *Di Zi Gui* has served as a foundational guide for generations, shaping the moral fabric of Chinese society and beyond.\n\nIn this blog, we'll explore the seven chapters of *Di Zi Gui*, uncovering its profound wisdom and practical lessons for living a meaningful and harmonious life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 1: At Home, Be Dutiful to My Parents (ÂÖ•ÂâáÂ≠ù)**\n\nThe foundation of *Di Zi Gui* lies in filial piety, the virtue of respecting and caring for one's parents. Confucius believed that a person's moral character begins at home, and this chapter outlines how children should honor their parents in both words and actions. From responding promptly to their calls to ensuring their comfort and well-being, the text emphasizes the importance of humility, obedience, and gratitude. Even in moments of disagreement, children are encouraged to advise their parents with kindness and respect.\n\nThis chapter also addresses the deep reverence owed to parents, even after their passing. By observing mourning rituals and maintaining a disciplined life, children demonstrate their enduring love and respect. Filial piety, as taught in *Di Zi Gui*, is not just a duty but a profound expression of gratitude and love.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 2: Standards for Younger Brothers (and Juniors) When Away from Home (Âá∫ÂâáÂºü)**\n\nHarmony within the family extends to relationships with siblings and elders. This chapter teaches younger siblings to respect their elders and older siblings to care for their juniors. By fostering mutual respect and avoiding conflicts over material possessions, families can maintain peace and unity.\n\nThe text also provides guidelines for interacting with elders outside the home, such as addressing them respectfully, yielding to them in public spaces, and showing humility in their presence. These principles reinforce the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society built on respect and deference.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 3: Be Cautious (or Reverent) in My Daily Life (Ë¨π)**\n\nDaily habits and routines are a reflection of one's character. This chapter emphasizes the importance of discipline, cleanliness, and mindfulness in everyday life. From waking up early to maintaining personal hygiene and dressing modestly, the text encourages individuals to cultivate self-respect and order.\n\nThe chapter also advises against excess, whether in food, drink, or behavior. By practicing moderation and avoiding distractions, individuals can focus on self-improvement and moral growth. These teachings remind us that small, consistent actions contribute to a virtuous life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 4: Be Trustworthy (‰ø°)**\n\nTrustworthiness is the cornerstone of all relationships. This chapter highlights the importance of honesty, integrity, and careful speech. It warns against deceit, gossip, and making promises lightly, urging individuals to think before they speak and act with sincerity.\n\nThe text also encourages self-reflection and accountability. When we make mistakes, we should acknowledge them and strive to improve. By cultivating trustworthiness, we build strong, lasting relationships and contribute to a more harmonious society.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 5: Love All Equally (Ê≥õÊÑõÁúæ)**\n\nConfucian philosophy extends the concept of love beyond the family to all of humanity. This chapter teaches us to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status or background. By avoiding arrogance, envy, and prejudice, we can foster a sense of unity and compassion.\n\nThe text also emphasizes the importance of helping others and resolving conflicts with reason rather than force. By practicing empathy and generosity, we create a world where everyone can thrive.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 6: Be Close to and Learn from People of Virtue and Compassion (Ë¶™‰ªÅ)**\n\nSurrounding ourselves with virtuous individuals is essential for personal growth. This chapter encourages us to seek out and learn from those who embody kindness, wisdom, and integrity. By associating with such people, we can improve our own character and avoid negative influences.\n\nThe text also warns against the dangers of associating with those who lack virtue, as their actions can lead us astray. Choosing our companions wisely is a key step on the path to moral excellence.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 7: After All the Above are Accomplished, I Should Study Further and Learn Literature and Art to Improve My Cultural and Spiritual Life (È§òÂäõÂ≠∏Êñá)**\n\nThe final chapter of *Di Zi Gui* reminds us that moral development must be complemented by intellectual and cultural growth. While practicing virtue is essential, studying literature, art, and philosophy enriches our minds and spirits.\n\nThe text provides practical advice for effective learning, such as maintaining a clean and organized study space, focusing on one task at a time, and seeking clarification when in doubt. By balancing moral practice with intellectual pursuit, we can achieve a well-rounded and fulfilling life.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: The Enduring Relevance of *Di Zi Gui***\n\nThough written centuries ago, *Di Zi Gui* remains a powerful guide for living a virtuous and harmonious life. Its teachings on filial piety, respect, trustworthiness, and self-improvement are as relevant today as they were in ancient China. In a world that often prioritizes material success over moral character, *Di Zi Gui* reminds us of the timeless values that truly matter.\n\nBy incorporating the wisdom of *Di Zi Gui* into our daily lives, we can cultivate stronger relationships, contribute to a more harmonious society, and embark on a lifelong journey of personal growth. Whether you're a student, a parent, or simply someone seeking to live a more meaningful life, this ancient text offers invaluable lessons for the modern world.\n\nLet us take inspiration from *Di Zi Gui* and strive to be good pupils, good children, and good human beings‚Äîone virtuous step at a time.","src/content/blog/250323-di-zi-gui.md","1ad12a40398087e3",{html:250,metadata:251},"<h1 id=\"the-timeless-wisdom-of-di-zi-gui-a-guide-to-living-a-virtuous-life\">The Timeless Wisdom of <em>Di Zi Gui</em>: A Guide to Living a Virtuous Life</h1>\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Zi_Gui\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Zi_Gui</a></p>\n<p>In the bustling world of modern life, where values often seem fleeting and traditions are sometimes forgotten, the ancient Chinese text <em>Di Zi Gui</em> (ÂºüÂ≠êË¶è, <em>Standards for Being a Good Pupil and Child</em>) offers a timeless roadmap for cultivating virtue, respect, and harmony in our daily lives.

From the 1st millennium AD, the Malay Peninsula and the broader Indosphere became a vibrant zone of cultural exchange, where Indian traditions, art, religion, and cuisine left an indelible mark. This blog delves into the fascinating history of these early kingdoms, their connections with India and China, and their lasting legacy in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **The Dawn of Indian Influence in Southeast Asia**\n\nThe Malay Peninsula, often referred to as *Suvarnadvipa* (Golden Peninsula) in ancient Indian texts like the *Ramayana* and *Vayu Purana*, was a focal point of early trade and cultural exchange. By the 3rd century BC, Indian merchants and travelers had begun to establish connections with Southeast Asia, bringing with them Hinduism, Buddhism, and the Sanskrit language. These influences were further solidified during the 4th and 5th centuries under the South Indian Pallava dynasty, which played a key role in spreading Indian culture across the region.\n\nThe adoption of Hinduism and Buddhism by the people of the Malay Peninsula had a profound impact on their language, art, and societal structures. Sanskrit inscriptions dating back to the 4th century are evidence of this cultural synthesis, which laid the foundation for the region's early kingdoms.\n\n---\n\n### **Early Kingdoms of the Malay Peninsula (3rd‚Äì7th Centuries)**\n\nBy the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the Malay Peninsula was home to as many as 30 small kingdoms, many of which were located on the eastern coast. Among the earliest and most notable was **Langkasuka**, a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom believed to have been situated in the northern part of the peninsula. Langkasuka maintained close ties with **Funan**, a powerful kingdom in Cambodia that also exerted influence over parts of northern Malaysia.\n\nOther early polities included **Chi Tu**, **Pan Pan**, and the **Kingdom of Pahang**, all of which were mentioned in Chinese and Indian records. These kingdoms thrived on trade and cultural exchange, serving as important hubs for merchants traveling between India and China.\n\nOne of the most intriguing early kingdoms was **Gangga Negara**, a semi-legendary Hindu kingdom in present-day Perak, Malaysia. According to the *Malay Annals*, Gangga Negara was founded by Raja Gangga Shah Johan, a descendant of Alexander the Great or Khmer royalty. While its historical accuracy remains debated, Gangga Negara symbolizes the deep-rooted Indian influence in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **Trade and Cultural Exchange: The Lifeline of Early Kingdoms**\n\nThe Malay Peninsula's strategic location made it a crucial link in the maritime trade routes connecting China and India. Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to the peninsula as the *Golden Chersonese*, highlighting its importance in ancient trade networks. Chinese pottery shards found in Borneo, dating back to the 1st century AD, attest to the early trade relations between the region and China.\n\nThe **Bujang Valley** in Kedah, with its Hindu temples and artifacts, stands as a testament to the vibrant trade and cultural exchange that took place. The valley, strategically located near the Strait of Malacca, was frequented by Indian and Chinese traders, leaving behind a rich archaeological legacy that includes sculptures, inscriptions, and monuments.\n\n---\n\n### **The Rise of Srivijaya (7th‚Äì13th Century)**\n\nBetween the 7th and 13th centuries, the **Srivijaya Empire** emerged as a dominant maritime power in Southeast Asia. Centered in Palembang, Sumatra, Srivijaya controlled much of the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding archipelago. The empire was built on trade, with local kings (dhatus) swearing allegiance to the Srivijayan Maharajas for mutual benefit.\n\nSrivijaya's influence extended far and wide, from the Malay Peninsula to parts of Java and Borneo. The empire's wealth and power were derived from its control over key trade routes and its ability to levy taxes on passing ships. However, Srivijaya's dominance began to wane in the 11th century due to conflicts with the **Chola Empire** of South India and the rise of competing powers like **Majapahit**.\n\n---\n\n### **The Chola Invasion and Its Aftermath**\n\nThe relationship between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire was initially friendly, but tensions escalated during the reign of **Rajendra Chola I**. In 1025, the Cholas launched a series of invasions, targeting Srivijaya's vassal states like **Kedah** (known as Kadaram in Tamil) and **Gangga Negara**. These invasions significantly weakened Srivijaya's hold over the region.\n\nThe Chola expeditions left a lasting impression on the Malay people, as evidenced by references to the Chola kings in the *Sejarah Melayu* (Malay Annals). Even today, the legacy of the Cholas is remembered in Malaysia, with many royal names bearing the suffix *Cholan* or *Chulan*.\n\n---\n\n### **Decline and the Rise of New Powers**\n\nBy the 12th century, Srivijaya's power had declined due to internal strife, external invasions, and the spread of Islam. The rise of the **Majapahit Empire** in Java and the expansion of the **Siamese Kingdom** further eroded Srivijaya's influence. By the late 13th century, much of the Malay Peninsula had come under Siamese control.\n\nThe final chapter of Srivijaya's legacy was written in the 14th century when **Sang Nila Utama**, a Srivijaya prince, founded the **Kingdom of Singapura** (Temasek). Although short-lived, Singapura laid the groundwork for the rise of the **Sultanate of Malacca** in the early 15th century, which became the next great Malay political entity in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: A Legacy That Endures**\n\nThe early Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia played a pivotal role in shaping the region's cultural and historical landscape. From the spread of Indian religions and scripts to the establishment of powerful maritime empires like Srivijaya, these kingdoms were at the heart of a vibrant network of trade and cultural exchange.\n\nToday, the legacy of these early kingdoms can be seen in the region's architecture, language, and traditions. The Bujang Valley, the ruins of Srivijaya, and the stories of Sang Nila Utama remind us of a time when the Malay Peninsula was a crossroads of civilizations, where the cultures of India, China, and Southeast Asia converged to create a unique and enduring heritage.\n\nWhether you're a history enthusiast or a curious traveler, exploring the remnants of these early kingdoms offers a fascinating glimpse into the rich tapestry of Southeast Asia's past.","src/content/blog/250323-malaysia-past.md","750a00e0da2baa6f",{html:298,metadata:299},"<h1 id=\"exploring-the-early-hindu-buddhist-kingdoms-of-southeast-asia-a-journey-through-greater-indias-cultural-legacy\">Exploring the Early Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms of Southeast Asia: A Journey Through Greater India‚Äôs Cultural Legacy</h1>\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Malaysia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Malaysia</a></p>\n<p>The history of Southeast Asia is deeply intertwined with the cultural, religious, and political influences of early Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms.

Simplifying something\nineffective won't make it useful. That's where Keep it Simple, Essential comes\nin: going beyond simplicity to find and focus on the essence of what truly\nmatters.\n\n1. **Identify the Core Purpose or Goal**\n2. **List Everything Down**\n3. **Evaluate Each Element's Value and Relevance**\n4. **Declutter Non-essentials** (only keep what sparks joy)\n5. **Optimize What's Left**\n6. **Regularly Reassess and Refine**\n\nBy emphasizing the essentials, this method allows room for complexity while\nkeeping the focus on what's important. Personally, I find this approach more\nefficient, and provides clarity from the start and helps me avoid wasting time\nand resources in non-essential tasks.\n\n## How I came to this\n\nOver the past few years, I've explored various areas and concepts, but my\nexperience with magfed paintball taught me the most about simplicity and\nessentials. In magfed game, you're limited by what you can carry |paintball\nmasks, a paintball marker (gun) with magazines that hold a fixed number of\npaintballs, and other gear.\n\nWith only a limited number of shots, you need to be efficient. Amidst the sweat,\npanic, and adrenaline, it taught you to stay calm under pressure.

But we've yet to build a \"typical\" scroll-driven animation. For this issue, let's put one together.\n\nThis past week, eBay dropped some docs for their Evo design system over at [playbook.ebay.com](https://playbook.ebay.com/). Having a browse, some things jumped out aside from the bold style. There's some [use of clamped fonts](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1859651305788277139) in the header and a physics box further down the page. What also caught the eye were some scroll-driven and scroll-triggered pieces. How could you make this?\n\n### Support options\n\nCSS scroll-driven animations are currently [only available in Chromium](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_animation-range). Which poses the question \"What about my non-Chromium users?\". You can approach this in different ways.\n\n1. Progressive enhancement with CSS: Display your images as a grid. If scroll animation has support, do the animation.\n    \n2. Progressive enhancement with JavaScript: Display your images as a grid. Use JavaScript to create the scroll animation. My preference is for using [GreenSock's ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/) for this.\n    \n3. Cover all bases: If you can do option 1, do it. Otherwise, try option 2.\n    \n\nThe typical approach will be option 2 based on the current support. It depends on how critical that scroll animation is to your design. You can do a lot with option 1. Especially when it's those \"little details\".\n\nIn today's demo, any animation is a \"bonus\". If a user scrolled our page and didn't see it, they wouldn't know unless they were looking for it. That said, let's do option 3!\n\n### The Grid\n\nFirst, you want to think about what elements you need to get this working. It's a grid of images.\n\nWhen you look at the animation you're trying to make, it's as if layers of the grid move at different rates. The best path here is to split the grid into layers and have each layer use the same grid layout. Then you can animate each layer with different timing.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"grid\">\n  <!-- 6 images for outer edges -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"outer.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    ...\n  </div>\n  <!-- 6 images for images one column in -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"inner.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    ...\n  </div>\n  <!-- 2 images top and bottom of center column -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"center-top.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    <img src=\"center-bottom.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div>\n  <!-- the center image that shrinks -->\n  <div class=\"scaler\">\n    <img src=\"center.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n  <div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHow about using CSS subgrid for this? You could use a subgrid to split the grid up in different ways. This provides an opportunity to create varied effects. In our example, sharing the grid layout might make working with that center image easier.\n\nStart with a grid layout (You can adjust the columns for smaller screen sizes in a media query).\n\n``` css\n.grid {\n  align-content: center;\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);\n  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  gap: 8%;\n  width: 1600px;\n  max-width: calc(100% - 4rem);\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\nNow for each layer, use `subgrid`. Using a subgrid lets each layer use the grid tracks from the parent. This snippet shows how the first layer sets out its images using `:nth-of-type(odd/even)` with `grid-column`.\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  display: grid;\n  /* cover it */\n  grid-column: 1 / -1;\n  grid-row: 1 / -1;\n  /* use subgrid */\n  grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n  grid-template-rows: subgrid;\n}\n.grid .layer:nth-of-type(1) img:nth-of-type(odd) {\n  grid-column: 1;\n}\n.grid .layer:nth-of-type(1) img:nth-of-type(even) {\n  grid-column: -1;\n}\n```\n\nThe scaling image goes in the center. It's a direct child so you can place it with `grid-area`.\n\n``` css\n.grid .scaler {\n  grid-area: 2 / 3;\n} \n```\n\nNow you have a grid of images ready to animate!\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ef883ca-c80b-408e-9624-8890d4a0fff0_1800x1350.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ef883ca-c80b-408e-9624-8890d4a0fff0_1800x1350.png)\n\nUsing the CSS Grid features in Chrome's Developer Tools\n\n**NOTE::** You may have to make a few adjustments to get things working in all browsers with subgrid. For example, a percentage gap didn't work for this demo in Safari. Switching to a clamped container query unit did work.\n\n### Laying Foundations\n\nScroll animations come in different shapes and sizes. There are a few common tricks. For this demo, you can use the \"sticky spacer\" trick. The gist is:\n\n1. Stick an element with what you want to animate using `position: sticky`\n    \n2. Make the parent container larger so it creates space\n    \n3. Animate based on the container position\n    \n\nThis demo presented at Figma Config (hence the Figma logo) shows how the trick works.\n\nIf you want to see a clip of me talking through that demo, it's here üëá (do not feel obliged)\n\nFor our demo. Wrap the grid in a content block inside a section.\n\n``` html\n<section>\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"grid\">\n     <!-- our grid content -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</section>\n```\n\nGive the section some extra height and make our content block sticky.\n\n``` css\nsection:first-of-type {\n  min-height: 240vh;\n}\n.content {\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can start animating things! One last thing before we move things. Be mindful of your users. Remember to check for two things in your CSS. Check for scroll animation support and that your users have no motion preferences.\n\n``` css\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0 100%){\n  /* animation code */\n}\n}\n```\n\n### Animating the Center\n\nThe animation for the center image is straightforward. Animate its `height` and `width` from `100vh` and `100vw`. An open-ended animation means the image will animate to its size within the grid.\n\nYou're animating based on the parent, so set a `view-timeline` on that element.\n\n``` css\nmain section:first-of-type {\n  view-timeline: --driver;\n}\n```\n\nThen use that in your animation.\n\n``` css\n.scaler img {\n  animation-name: scale-x, scale-y;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n  animation-timing-function: var(--power-2), var(--power-1);\n  animation-timeline: --driver;\n  animation-range: entry 100% exit -20%;\n}\n@keyframes scale-x {\n  0%, 10% { width: calc(100vw - 4rem); }\n}\n@keyframes scale-y {\n  0%, 10% { height: calc(100vh - 4rem); }\n}\n```\n\nTo break that down:\n\n- Set 2 animations, `scale-x` and `scale-y`\n    \n- Set `animation-fill-mode` to `both`\n    \n- Use our `view-timeline` as the `animation-timeline`\n    \n- Set the `animation-range` to start once the parent has entered and finish 20% before it starts to exit\n    \n- Use a different timing function for each so it doesn't feel too linear (more on this in a moment)\n    \n\nAnd this gives you something like this!\n\n### Animating the Layers\n\nThe last piece is the layers. You use the same `view-timeline` but drive two different keyframes.\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  animation-name: fade, reveal;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n  animation-timeline: --driver;\n  animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-1);\n  animation-range: entry 100% exit 0%;\n}\n@keyframes fade { 0%, 55% { opacity: 0; }}\n@keyframes reveal { 0%, 30% { scale: 0; }}\n```\n\nThere are a few ways to get the stagger. You could opt to adjust the `animation-range` for each layer. An alternative could be for all layers to use the same range but have different `animation-timing`.\n\nUsing `animation-range` could look something like this:\n\n``` sass\n.grid .layer {\n  &:nth-of-type(1) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit 0%;\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(2) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit -10%;\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(3) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit -20%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing `animation-timing-function` could look something like this:\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  &:nth-of-type(1) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-1);\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(2) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-3);\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(3) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-4);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe extra part about using `animation-timing-function` is defining the different easing curves. CSS now has support for custom timing curves via linear(). I built a [rudimentary demo to help me use GreenSock eases in CSS](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1696651285456421375). Type in the easing string and get back the CSS equal. For this demo, \"`--power-1`\", \"`--power-2`\", etc. look wild. But they're written once, then not touched again.\n\n``` css\n.layer {\n--power-1-out: linear(\n    0 0%,\n    0.0027 3.64%,\n    0.0106 7.29%,\n    0.0425 14.58%,\n    0.0957 21.87%,\n    0.1701 29.16%,\n    0.2477 35.19%,\n    0.3401 41.23%,\n    0.5982 55.18%,\n    0.7044 61.56%,\n    0.7987 68.28%,\n    0.875 75%,\n    0.9297 81.25%,\n    0.9687 87.5%,\n    0.9922 93.75%,\n    1 100%\n  );\n}\n```\n\nHere are the animated layers showcasing both staggers.\n\nAnd here are the grid layers shown in DevTools\n\n---\n\nThat's it for your CSS implementation. There was mention of a JavaScript solution above. Without digging deep, this could be the [GreenSock ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) timeline for the center image. (You can wrap it in a support check like we did in the previous issue)\n\n``` css\ngsap\n  .timeline({\n    scrollTrigger: {\n      trigger: 'main section:first-of-type',\n      start: 'top -10%',\n      end: 'bottom 80%',\n      scrub: true,\n    },\n  })\n  .from(\n    '.scaler img',\n    {\n      height: window.innerHeight - 32,\n      ease: 'power1.inOut',\n    }\n  )\n  .from(\n    '.scaler img',\n    {\n      width: window.innerWidth - 32,\n      ease: 'power2.inOut',\n    },\n    0\n  )\n```\n\nYou create a GreenSock timeline and use the ScrollTrigger to drive it. That will work fine and you can adjust it as you wish. There is the potential that you may write more this way. An example is how you handled timing functions in the CSS for the scaling image.\n\n---\n\nLast things last, before we go. Remember option 1? How it's good to enhance as a bonus? Those little details?  ï‚äô·¥•‚äô î\n\nUntil next time!\n\n---\n\n**Demo link: [codepen.io/jh3y](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/VYZwOwd/e336a907b7514f67b9eca281d625b774)  \nOn X: [x.com/jh3yy](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1859789759167726065)  \nOn BlueSky: [bsky.app/jhey.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/jhey.dev/post/3lbiy7z6pek23)**","src/content/blog/2024/241205-rabbit holes goes on forever.md","279b5ea7b011d368",{html:413,metadata:414},"<h1 id=\"scrolling-a-page-out-of-the-playbook-test\">Scrolling a page out of the Playbook (test)</h1>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-scroll-driven-gallery-effect-with-css\">Creating a scroll-driven gallery effect with CSS</h3>\n<p>In the past two issues, we‚Äôve referenced CSS scroll-driven animations.

Its static-first approach, combined with minimal JavaScript and flexibility, aligns perfectly with my goals of building fast, SEO-friendly, and sustainable projects. Here's why Astro.js stands out and how I'm using it in my web development journey.\n\n## What Makes Astro.js the Perfect Choice for Me?\n\nWhen searching for a static site generator, I wanted something simple and lightweight‚Äîfree of unnecessary bloat, routers, or framework-specific dependencies. I initially considered Gridsome and Jekyll, but their support had waned by the time I found them. Fortunately, I discovered Astro.js.\n\nAst's philosophy of building static sites by default, with the option to add JavaScript only when needed, was exactly what I was looking for. This modular, \"only-add-what-you-need\" approach ensures every site is fast, efficient, and easy to maintain.\n\n## Key Features of Astro.js\n\n### üí° **Island Architecture**\n\nAstro only loads JavaScript for interactive components, drastically reducing page load times while delivering a great user experience.\n\n### üí° **Component Agnosticism**\n\nWhether you use React, Vue, Svelte, or Preact, Astro integrates seamlessly, offering unparalleled flexibility for component design.\n\n### üí° **Static Site Generation (SSG)**\n\nAstro generates static HTML by default, ensuring lightning-fast load times and improved SEO‚Äîa cornerstone of modern web performance.\n\n### üí° **Markdown/MDX Support**\n\nAstro's built-in support for Markdown and MDX simplifies content creation, making it ideal for blogs, documentation, and content-heavy sites.\n\n---\n\n## Why Astro.js Aligns with My Goals\n\n### üöÄ **Performance-Optimized**\n\nAstro's static-first philosophy is perfect for projects where performance is key, such as blogs, portfolios, and documentation.\n\n### üåç **Sustainable Web Development**\n\nBy reducing JavaScript load, Astro aligns with my goal of building environmentally conscious websites.\n\n### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer-Friendly**\n\nAstro's simplicity and flexibility let me focus on what matters‚Äîdelivering value to my clients and users. No more struggling with routing complexities just to create a simple \"About Us\" page.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Example: Client Microsites\n\nAstro.js has proven invaluable for my client projects. For instance, I built a course microsite where reusable components‚Äîsuch as blog posts, announcements, and service descriptions‚Äîallowed for quick updates without diving into complex CMS systems.\n\nThis streamlined workflow not only saved time but also ensured consistency across the site, demonstrating Astro's effectiveness in simplifying maintenance for content-heavy projects.\n\nBefore this, I was using Nuxt.js, which is itself a framework of a JavaScript framework (Vue.js). It was mind-numbing to have to learn two frameworks just to enjoy a few great tools for building a simple website.\n\n---\n\n## Other Real-World Applications of Astro.js\n\n1. **Personal Blog**: Create a high-performance blog with Markdown support, ensuring fast load times and excellent SEO. Fun fact: the site you're reading this on was built with Astro.js!\n    \n2. **Documentation Site**: Build a static documentation site with dynamic navigation using partial hydration for a seamless user experience.\n    \n\nFor those new to Astro, I recommend exploring free themes available at [Astro Themes](https://astro.build/themes/) to kickstart your project.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps in My Astro.js Journey\n\nAstro has grown significantly since its launch in 2021, with its latest version (v5) offering even more tools and capabilities. I'm excited to explore these advanced features and incorporate them into my projects.\n\n1. **Explore Advanced Features**: Dive deeper into Content Collections and Content Layers.\n2. **Explore Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Also a new feature call Server Island, where dynamic content can be render via Server-side.\n3. **Create Tutorials**: Share insights and guides to help others adopt Astro.js in their projects.\n\n---\n\n> \"A lightweight site gives space for the content to breathe and the mind to wander.\"","src/content/blog/2024/241212-Why I Chose Astro.js for My Web Development Journey.md","fe8a2ca6e550d7e8",{html:457,metadata:458},"<p>Astro.js has become my go-to framework for creating performant, scalable, and content-focused websites.
