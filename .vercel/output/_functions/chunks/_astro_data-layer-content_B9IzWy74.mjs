However, there are speed and security issues associated with using Google Fonts directly. In this post, we will explore these issues and provide a solution on how to write your own custom font-face declaration for better performance and security.\n\n## The Problem with Google Fonts\nThe convenience of Google Fonts comes with two main issues:\n\n1. **Speed**\n\n    When you use Google Fonts, you are not optimizing the speed at which your fonts load. This can affect the performance of your website, especially if you are using multiple fonts.\n\n2. **Privacy and Security**\n\n    Google Fonts has faced legal challenges due to privacy and security concerns. Using Google Fonts requires you to comply with certain legal requirements, which can be a hassle.\n\n## The Solution: Custom Font-Face Declaration\nTo address these issues, you can set up your own font-face that you load up for users. This process involves downloading a font, declaring a font-face, and then using the font in your CSS. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Download a Font**\n\n    You can download a font from a site like Font Share, which offers free fonts. Make sure to download different versions of the font (e.g., regular, bold, italic) in various formats (e.g., woff2, woff, ttf) for maximum compatibility.\n\n2. **Declare a Font-Face**\n  \n    In your CSS, you can declare a font-face. This involves specifying the font family name, the source (src) of the font files, the font style, and the font weight. You can also provide a list of sources as a fallback stack, starting with the most preferred format.\n\n3. **Use the Font**\n  \n    Once you've declared the font-face, you can use the font in your CSS by specifying the font family.\n\n## Enhancing the Solution: Local Fonts and Variable Fonts\nYou can further enhance this solution in two ways:\n\n1. **Local Fonts**\n\n    You can declare a local font file so that the browser will use whatever's on the user's system first and then only default to what you're uploading if they don't have it on their system. This can significantly improve the speed at which your fonts load.\n\n2. **Variable Fonts**\n\n    Variable fonts are a more modern way to use fonts. They allow you to use a single font file for multiple variations, which can reduce the number of fonts that need to be downloaded.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile Google Fonts is a convenient resource, it's not always the best solution for every project. By setting up your own font-face, you can improve the speed and security of your website. Plus, you can provide a better user experience by using local fonts and variable fonts.","src/content/blog/_draft/230614-optimizing_google_fonts.md","991fb7c40cf65880",{html:227,metadata:228},"<p>Google Fonts is an amazing resource that many web developers rely on for their projects.

Then, create a new file named .htpasswd in a secure location on your server, ideally outside the web root directory. Add the following line to this file:\n\n```\nusername:encrypted_password\n```\n\n\n![this is a placeholder](/postassets/placeholder.png)\n\nReplace 'username' with your desired username and 'encrypted_password' with the generated encrypted password.\n\n## Modifying the .htaccess File\n\nNext, locate the .htaccess file in the root directory of your staging WordPress installation.

This change in terminology reflects a shift in how we measure user success on our websites. Whether it's making a purchase, signing up for an account, or downloading an ebook, these actions can all be defined as conversions. But how do we set up these conversions in GA4? Let's dive in.\n\n## Sending Events to Google Analytics 4\nThe first step in setting up conversions in GA4 is to send your event to GA4. An event could be anything that signifies user success on your website. For instance, if you have a contact form on your website, you might want to track form submissions as conversions. To do this, you need to send a 'form_submit' event to GA4.\n\nThe event you sent to GA4 may need to wait for 48 hours to show up. Once it does appears, you can mark it as a conversion by toggling the 'Mark as conversion' button.\n\n## Creating a Custom Event\nWhat if you want to track a page view as a conversion? For instance, you might want to track visits to a 'Thank You' page as conversions. In this case, you can create a custom event based on the 'page_view' event.\n\nTo create a custom event, go to the 'Create Event' section in GA4 and give your event a name. Then, set the event name to 'page\\_view' and add a condition that the 'page\\_location' contains 'thank you page'.\n\nOnce you've created your custom event, you need to wait for it to show up in your GA4 account. This can also take up to 48 hours. Once your custom event appears in your account, you can mark it as a conversion in the same way as before.\n\n## Viewing Your Conversions\nOnce you've set up your conversions, you can view them in your GA4 reports. Under the 'Engagement' section, you'll find a 'Conversions' report that shows a graph of your conversions and a list of the conversions that have been counted.\n\nYou can also view your conversions in context by looking at other reports. For instance, in the 'User Acquisition' report, you can see where your users are coming from and how many of them are converting.\n\n## Conclusion\nSetting up conversions in GA4 involves sending events to GA4 and marking them as conversions. While this process requires some patience, it's crucial for measuring user success on your website. By tracking conversions, you can gain valuable insights into your users' behavior and make data-driven decisions to improve your website.\n\n---\n\n**source:** [How to Configure GA4 Goals and Conversions - MeasureSchool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-UWyCMnTsU)","src/content/blog/_draft/230618-ga4_how_to_conversion.md","d973e7186f875358",{html:343,metadata:344},"<p>In Google Analytics 4 (GA4), the concept of ‘goals’ from Universal Analytics has been replaced with ‘conversions’.

For instance, you might want to display something different on the home page than on category pages.\n\n## Commonly Used WordPress Conditional Tags\n\nTwo of the commonly used conditional tags are `is_front_page()` and `is_home()`.\n\n- `is_front_page()`: Checks if the front page is being displayed. This is usually true when the user navigates to the website root URL.\n    \n- `is_home()`: Checks if the blog posts index page is being displayed. This is typically true when the user navigates to the main blog listing page.\n    \n\n## Using `is_front_page()` and `is_home()`\n\nYou can use these tags in your theme files to determine what content to display. Here's a simple usage example:\n\n\n```\nif (is_front_page() && is_home()) {\n    // The front page is set to display the latest posts.\n    // Display specific content for this scenario.\n} elseif (is_front_page()) {\n    // The front page is set to display a static page.\n    // Display specific content for this scenario.\n} elseif (is_home()) {\n    // The blog posts index page is set to display a static page other than the front page.\n    // Display specific content for this scenario.\n}\n```\n\n## The Difference Between `is_front_page()` and `is_home()`\n\nIn WordPress, you can set your front page to display either a static page or the latest posts. The settings can be found under Settings > Reading in the WordPress admin panel.\n\nIf you set \"Your homepage displays\" to \"Your latest posts\", then `is_front_page()` and `is_home()` will both return `true` when on the main URL of your website.\n\nIf you set \"Your homepage displays\" to \"A static page\", then:\n\n- `is_front_page()` will return `true` on the static page you set to be the homepage.\n- `is_home()` will return `true` on the page you set to be the blog posts index.\n\nThese conditional tags offer powerful tools for controlling what content is displayed on various parts of your WordPress site. They form the basis for creating dynamic and interactive themes that can cater to a wide range of design requirements.","src/content/blog/_draft/230711-wordpress_conditional_tags.md","3d4532c52f064d2e",{html:372,metadata:373},"<h2 id=\"what-are-wordpress-conditional-tags\">What are WordPress Conditional Tags?</h2>\n<p>Conditional tags are functions used in WordPress themes and plugins to change the content displayed on a particular page depending on what conditions that page matches.

Streamline your data import process as a web developer.",["Date","2023-07-12T16:00:00.000Z"],[148,149],"As a web developer working with WordPress, you often encounter situations where you need to import a large amount of data into your website. One efficient and convenient method to accomplish this is by using a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. In this blog post, we will explore the process of importing data from a CSV file and creating/updating posts and pages in WordPress. This guide aims to provide valuable insights and practical steps for web developers who want to streamline their data import process.\n\n## Understanding the CSV Format\n\nBefore diving into the import process, let's familiarize ourselves with the CSV format. A CSV file is a plain text file where each line represents a row of data, and the values within each row are separated by commas. The first row often contains the column headers, which correspond to the data fields in your WordPress posts or pages.\n\n## Preparing the CSV File\n\nTo begin the import process, you need a well-structured CSV file that aligns with your desired post or page structure. Ensure that the column headers match the respective fields in WordPress, such as title, slug, content, excerpt, categories, tags, and more. Tools like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets can assist in creating and organizing the CSV file.\n\n## Establishing the Import Functionality\n\nTo import data from the CSV file, you will need to write a custom function or plugin within your WordPress development environment. This function should handle the parsing of the CSV file, mapping the data to the appropriate WordPress fields, and creating or updating posts/pages accordingly. The WordPress function `fgetcsv()` is particularly useful for reading and extracting data from the CSV file.\n\n## Implementing the Data Import Process\n\n1.  **Open the CSV File**: Use PHP's `fopen()` function to open the CSV file and establish a file handle for further operations.\n2.  **Read the CSV Rows**: Utilize `fgetcsv()` to read each row of the CSV file, retrieving the data as an array.\n3.  **Process Each Row**: Iterate through the CSV rows and extract the relevant data for creating/updating posts or pages. Validate and sanitize the data as necessary.\n4.  **Create/Update Posts or Pages**: Use WordPress functions like `wp_insert_post()` or `wp_update_post()` to create new posts or update existing ones based on the data extracted from the CSV file. Make sure to map the data fields correctly to their respective WordPress counterparts (e.g., title, content, categories, etc.).\n5.  **Handle Relationships and Meta Data**: If your posts or pages have relationships or additional meta data, such as featured images, custom taxonomies, or custom fields, ensure that you incorporate the necessary logic to handle these aspects during the import process.\n6.  **Testing and Error Handling**: It's crucial to thoroughly test the data import functionality before performing a full-scale import. Handle potential errors gracefully and log any issues that arise for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nImporting data from a CSV file can significantly simplify the process of creating or updating posts and pages in WordPress. By understanding the CSV format, preparing the CSV file correctly, and implementing the data import functionality, web developers can save valuable time and effort when dealing with large amounts of content. Remember to validate and sanitize the data, handle relationships and meta data, and thoroughly test the import process to ensure a smooth and successful data import experience.","src/content/blog/_draft/230713-wordpress_conditional_tags copy.md","c37ed22aacb79db9",{html:404,metadata:405},"<p>As a web developer working with WordPress, you often encounter situations where you need to import a large amount of data into your website.

As a website owner, this user-generated data is of utmost importance. If you are looking for an efficient, easy-to-implement way to capture and store this data, consider using Google Sheets as a makeshift database.\n\nIn this article, we guide you through the steps of setting up a form-to-Google Sheets data pipeline, with an added emphasis on handling the associated security aspects.\n\n## Creating a Google Cloud Project\n\nYour first step towards implementing a Google Sheets database involves creating a Google Cloud Project.\n\n1.  **Navigate to the Google Cloud Console**: Head over to the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cloud Console</a> to start your project.\n2.  **Create a New Project**: Once there, you can create a new project by clicking on \"Select a project\" at the top of the page, followed by \"New Project\" on the subsequent page.\n3.  **Fill in the Details**: You'll then be asked to fill in the necessary details such as the project name, billing information, and others.\n\nYou may also opt to use an existing project if it fits the requirements of your current data capturing needs.\n\n## Enabling Google Sheets API and Generating Credentials\n\nWith your project selected, the next step is to enable the Google Sheets API and generate the necessary credentials:\n\n1.  **Search for Google Sheets API**: Enter \"Google Sheets API\" in the search bar at the top of the Google Cloud Console.\n2.  **Enable the API**: Click on \"Enable\" to activate the Google Sheets API for your project.\n3.  **Navigate to Credentials**: Go to the \"Credentials\" option in the APIs & Services menu.\n4.  **Create Service Account**: Click on \"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS\" and choose \"Service account\". Follow the prompts, and at the end, you'll have a JSON file downloaded to your machine. This file contains the credentials your application will use to authenticate itself with Google Sheets API.\n\nRemember to note the generated email address for the service account. It usually follows the format: <ins>your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com</ins>.\n\n## Creating Google Sheets and Sharing with the Service Account\n\nWith the service account created and API enabled, your next move is to set up the Google Sheet that will act as your database:\n\n1.  **Create a New Google Sheet**: Create a new Google Sheets document. You may also use an existing one if it suits your needs.\n2.  **Share with Service Account**: Share this sheet with the service account's email address, granting \"Editor\" permissions. This allows your application to make changes to the Sheet via the Google Sheets API.\n\nYou will also need to extract the Google Sheets ID from the URL. It follows this pattern: <ins>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheetID}</ins>.\n\n## Setting up a Google Apps Script Project\n\nThe next step in the process requires a bit of coding knowledge. You'll need to set up a Google Apps Script project to handle the incoming form data:\n\n1.  **Navigate to Google Apps Script**: Go to <ins>https://script.google.com/</ins> to create a new Apps Script project.\n2.  **Create New Script**: Here, you'll write and deploy a script that handles incoming POST requests and writes data to your Google Sheets document.\n\n## Granting Permissions\n\nWhen you run the Apps Script or deploy your web application for the first time, it will ask for certain permissions. Granting these permissions allows the application to make changes to the Google Sheets document on your behalf.\n\n## Sharing the Spreadsheet ID and Service Account JSON\n\nThe final setup step involves sharing the service account JSON file and the spreadsheet ID with your development team or the person in charge of the form-to-database pipeline.\n\nThis should be done securely to prevent unauthorized access to your Google Sheets database.\n\n# A Focus on Security\n\nHandling user data carries a responsibility to protect their privacy and security.

As a website owner, this user-generated data is of utmost importance. If you are looking for an efficient, easy-to-implement way to capture and store this data, consider using Google Sheets as a makeshift database.</p>\n<p>In this article, we guide you through the steps of setting up a form-to-Google Sheets data pipeline, with an added emphasis on handling the associated security aspects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-google-cloud-project\">Creating a Google Cloud Project</h2>\n<p>Your first step towards implementing a Google Sheets database involves creating a Google Cloud Project.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Navigate to the Google Cloud Console</strong>: Head over to the <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Cloud Console</a> to start your project.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a New Project</strong>: Once there, you can create a new project by clicking on “Select a project” at the top of the page, followed by “New Project” on the subsequent page.</li>\n<li><strong>Fill in the Details</strong>: You’ll then be asked to fill in the necessary details such as the project name, billing information, and others.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may also opt to use an existing project if it fits the requirements of your current data capturing needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enabling-google-sheets-api-and-generating-credentials\">Enabling Google Sheets API and Generating Credentials</h2>\n<p>With your project selected, the next step is to enable the Google Sheets API and generate the necessary credentials:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search for Google Sheets API</strong>: Enter “Google Sheets API” in the search bar at the top of the Google Cloud Console.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable the API</strong>: Click on “Enable” to activate the Google Sheets API for your project.</li>\n<li><strong>Navigate to Credentials</strong>: Go to the “Credentials” option in the APIs &#x26; Services menu.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Service Account</strong>: Click on ”+ CREATE CREDENTIALS” and choose “Service account”. Follow the prompts, and at the end, you’ll have a JSON file downloaded to your machine. This file contains the credentials your application will use to authenticate itself with Google Sheets API.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember to note the generated email address for the service account. It usually follows the format: <ins><a href=\"mailto:your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\">your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com</a></ins>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-google-sheets-and-sharing-with-the-service-account\">Creating Google Sheets and Sharing with the Service Account</h2>\n<p>With the service account created and API enabled, your next move is to set up the Google Sheet that will act as your database:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a New Google Sheet</strong>: Create a new Google Sheets document. You may also use an existing one if it suits your needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Share with Service Account</strong>: Share this sheet with the service account’s email address, granting “Editor” permissions. This allows your application to make changes to the Sheet via the Google Sheets API.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You will also need to extract the Google Sheets ID from the URL. It follows this pattern: <ins><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/%7BspreadsheetID%7D\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheetID}</a></ins>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-a-google-apps-script-project\">Setting up a Google Apps Script Project</h2>\n<p>The next step in the process requires a bit of coding knowledge. You’ll need to set up a Google Apps Script project to handle the incoming form data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Navigate to Google Apps Script</strong>: Go to <ins><a href=\"https://script.google.com/\">https://script.google.com/</a></ins> to create a new Apps Script project.</li>\n<li><strong>Create New Script</strong>: Here, you’ll write and deploy a script that handles incoming POST requests and writes data to your Google Sheets document.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"granting-permissions\">Granting Permissions</h2>\n<p>When you run the Apps Script or deploy your web application for the first time, it will ask for certain permissions. Granting these permissions allows the application to make changes to the Google Sheets document on your behalf.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sharing-the-spreadsheet-id-and-service-account-json\">Sharing the Spreadsheet ID and Service Account JSON</h2>\n<p>The final setup step involves sharing the service account JSON file and the spreadsheet ID with your development team or the person in charge of the form-to-database pipeline.</p>\n<p>This should be done securely to prevent unauthorized access to your Google Sheets database.</p>\n<h1 id=\"a-focus-on-security\">A Focus on Security</h1>\n<p>Handling user data carries a responsibility to protect their privacy and security. Always ensure to handle sensitive data carefully, adhering to best practices for data storage and transmission.</p>\n<p>While Google Sheets can serve as a basic database for small applications, it is not designed to be a full-fledged, secure database solution. It does not offer the same level of security or scalability that dedicated databases like Firebase, MySQL, or PostgreSQL provide.

But when should you actually optimize your code? This blog post, based on the insightful video by CodeAesthetic, discusses the balance between performance, velocity, and adaptability in code optimization.\n\n## The Trade-off Triangle\n\nWhen it comes to code optimization, there's a trade-off triangle between velocity (how quickly you add new features), adaptability (how well the system can change to new requirements), and performance.\n\nFocusing on velocity means hacking together something as fast as possible, often creating technical debt that will slow you down in the long run. On the other hand, focusing on adaptability means writing code in a way that enables changes as new requirements come in. This could involve creating reusable, extensible components and beautifully crafted interfaces. However, if you make things too adaptable, you also hurt velocity and performance.\n\n## Performance: Not the First Problem\n\nPerformance is a problem, but it's not usually the first problem. It's important to be deliberate about which way you're leaning in the trade-off triangle. For instance, a feature-complete game pushing its final ship date would focus on performance, while a game earlier in development might focus on getting more features out quickly or building up an extensible system.\n\n## The Cost of Premature Optimization\n\nPremature optimization usually occurs for micro performance. This is typically where someone comments in a code review that you should do X instead of Y because X is faster than Y. But computers are really fast, and getting to the solution of a real-world problem faster is usually better than solving the problem slower with faster code.\n\n## The Importance of Measuring\n\nThe key to proper optimization is measuring. Your assumptions of what will make things faster can actually make things slower. Data structure selection is by far the most important aspect of performance issues, as choosing the right data structure can give dramatically better results over the wrong one.\n\n## Profiling: Finding the Hot Spots\n\nWhen dealing with performance issues, a profiler can tell you what the hot spots of your code are. It can point out the functions that are the most expensive. Sometimes, when things are slow, it's just one silly thing slowing everything down.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen you optimize, first have a real performance problem, then measure it. Try to make 80% moves by swapping data structures or moving to a well-known faster algorithm. Profile and find hot spots. Then, worst case, start thinking about what your code is doing under the hood.\n\n## Further\n\nFor more in-depth discussion on macro optimization strategies, check out the deleted scenes on CodeAesthetic's Patreon.\n\n## Keywords\n\n- Premature Optimization\n- Code Optimization\n- Performance\n- Velocity\n- Adaptability\n- Trade-off Triangle\n- Micro Performance\n- Measuring\n- Data Structure Selection\n- Profiling\n- Hot Spots\n\n---\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKbV6BpH-C8","src/content/blog/_draft/230723-premature_optimization.md","12b9593a97d115a6",{html:585,metadata:586},"<p>Premature optimization is often considered the root of all evil in programming.

But we've yet to build a \"typical\" scroll-driven animation. For this issue, let's put one together.\n\nThis past week, eBay dropped some docs for their Evo design system over at [playbook.ebay.com](https://playbook.ebay.com/). Having a browse, some things jumped out aside from the bold style. There's some [use of clamped fonts](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1859651305788277139) in the header and a physics box further down the page. What also caught the eye were some scroll-driven and scroll-triggered pieces. How could you make this?\n\n### Support options\n\nCSS scroll-driven animations are currently [only available in Chromium](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_animation-range). Which poses the question \"What about my non-Chromium users?\". You can approach this in different ways.\n\n1. Progressive enhancement with CSS: Display your images as a grid. If scroll animation has support, do the animation.\n    \n2. Progressive enhancement with JavaScript: Display your images as a grid. Use JavaScript to create the scroll animation. My preference is for using [GreenSock's ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/) for this.\n    \n3. Cover all bases: If you can do option 1, do it. Otherwise, try option 2.\n    \n\nThe typical approach will be option 2 based on the current support. It depends on how critical that scroll animation is to your design. You can do a lot with option 1. Especially when it's those \"little details\".\n\nIn today's demo, any animation is a \"bonus\". If a user scrolled our page and didn't see it, they wouldn't know unless they were looking for it. That said, let's do option 3!\n\n### The Grid\n\nFirst, you want to think about what elements you need to get this working. It's a grid of images.\n\nWhen you look at the animation you're trying to make, it's as if layers of the grid move at different rates. The best path here is to split the grid into layers and have each layer use the same grid layout. Then you can animate each layer with different timing.\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"grid\">\n  <!-- 6 images for outer edges -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"outer.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    ...\n  </div>\n  <!-- 6 images for images one column in -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"inner.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    ...\n  </div>\n  <!-- 2 images top and bottom of center column -->\n  <div class=\"layer\">\n    <img src=\"center-top.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n    <img src=\"center-bottom.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n  </div>\n  <!-- the center image that shrinks -->\n  <div class=\"scaler\">\n    <img src=\"center.avif\" alt=\"\" />\n  <div>\n</div>\n```\n\nHow about using CSS subgrid for this? You could use a subgrid to split the grid up in different ways. This provides an opportunity to create varied effects. In our example, sharing the grid layout might make working with that center image easier.\n\nStart with a grid layout (You can adjust the columns for smaller screen sizes in a media query).\n\n``` css\n.grid {\n  align-content: center;\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);\n  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);\n  gap: 8%;\n  width: 1600px;\n  max-width: calc(100% - 4rem);\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\nNow for each layer, use `subgrid`. Using a subgrid lets each layer use the grid tracks from the parent. This snippet shows how the first layer sets out its images using `:nth-of-type(odd/even)` with `grid-column`.\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  display: grid;\n  /* cover it */\n  grid-column: 1 / -1;\n  grid-row: 1 / -1;\n  /* use subgrid */\n  grid-template-columns: subgrid;\n  grid-template-rows: subgrid;\n}\n.grid .layer:nth-of-type(1) img:nth-of-type(odd) {\n  grid-column: 1;\n}\n.grid .layer:nth-of-type(1) img:nth-of-type(even) {\n  grid-column: -1;\n}\n```\n\nThe scaling image goes in the center. It's a direct child so you can place it with `grid-area`.\n\n``` css\n.grid .scaler {\n  grid-area: 2 / 3;\n} \n```\n\nNow you have a grid of images ready to animate!\n\n[\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ef883ca-c80b-408e-9624-8890d4a0fff0_1800x1350.png)\n\n\n\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ef883ca-c80b-408e-9624-8890d4a0fff0_1800x1350.png)\n\nUsing the CSS Grid features in Chrome's Developer Tools\n\n**NOTE::** You may have to make a few adjustments to get things working in all browsers with subgrid. For example, a percentage gap didn't work for this demo in Safari. Switching to a clamped container query unit did work.\n\n### Laying Foundations\n\nScroll animations come in different shapes and sizes. There are a few common tricks. For this demo, you can use the \"sticky spacer\" trick. The gist is:\n\n1. Stick an element with what you want to animate using `position: sticky`\n    \n2. Make the parent container larger so it creates space\n    \n3. Animate based on the container position\n    \n\nThis demo presented at Figma Config (hence the Figma logo) shows how the trick works.\n\nIf you want to see a clip of me talking through that demo, it's here 👇 (do not feel obliged)\n\nFor our demo. Wrap the grid in a content block inside a section.\n\n``` html\n<section>\n  <div class=\"content\">\n    <div class=\"grid\">\n     <!-- our grid content -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</section>\n```\n\nGive the section some extra height and make our content block sticky.\n\n``` css\nsection:first-of-type {\n  min-height: 240vh;\n}\n.content {\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n}\n```\n\nNow you can start animating things! One last thing before we move things. Be mindful of your users. Remember to check for two things in your CSS. Check for scroll animation support and that your users have no motion preferences.\n\n``` css\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) and (animation-range: 0 100%){\n  /* animation code */\n}\n}\n```\n\n### Animating the Center\n\nThe animation for the center image is straightforward. Animate its `height` and `width` from `100vh` and `100vw`. An open-ended animation means the image will animate to its size within the grid.\n\nYou're animating based on the parent, so set a `view-timeline` on that element.\n\n``` css\nmain section:first-of-type {\n  view-timeline: --driver;\n}\n```\n\nThen use that in your animation.\n\n``` css\n.scaler img {\n  animation-name: scale-x, scale-y;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n  animation-timing-function: var(--power-2), var(--power-1);\n  animation-timeline: --driver;\n  animation-range: entry 100% exit -20%;\n}\n@keyframes scale-x {\n  0%, 10% { width: calc(100vw - 4rem); }\n}\n@keyframes scale-y {\n  0%, 10% { height: calc(100vh - 4rem); }\n}\n```\n\nTo break that down:\n\n- Set 2 animations, `scale-x` and `scale-y`\n    \n- Set `animation-fill-mode` to `both`\n    \n- Use our `view-timeline` as the `animation-timeline`\n    \n- Set the `animation-range` to start once the parent has entered and finish 20% before it starts to exit\n    \n- Use a different timing function for each so it doesn't feel too linear (more on this in a moment)\n    \n\nAnd this gives you something like this!\n\n### Animating the Layers\n\nThe last piece is the layers. You use the same `view-timeline` but drive two different keyframes.\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  animation-name: fade, reveal;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n  animation-timeline: --driver;\n  animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-1);\n  animation-range: entry 100% exit 0%;\n}\n@keyframes fade { 0%, 55% { opacity: 0; }}\n@keyframes reveal { 0%, 30% { scale: 0; }}\n```\n\nThere are a few ways to get the stagger. You could opt to adjust the `animation-range` for each layer. An alternative could be for all layers to use the same range but have different `animation-timing`.\n\nUsing `animation-range` could look something like this:\n\n``` sass\n.grid .layer {\n  &:nth-of-type(1) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit 0%;\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(2) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit -10%;\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(3) {\n    animation-range: entry 100% exit -20%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing `animation-timing-function` could look something like this:\n\n``` css\n.grid .layer {\n  &:nth-of-type(1) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-1);\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(2) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-3);\n  }\n  &:nth-of-type(3) {\n    animation-timing-function: var(--sine), var(--power-4);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe extra part about using `animation-timing-function` is defining the different easing curves. CSS now has support for custom timing curves via linear(). I built a [rudimentary demo to help me use GreenSock eases in CSS](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1696651285456421375). Type in the easing string and get back the CSS equal. For this demo, \"`--power-1`\", \"`--power-2`\", etc. look wild. But they're written once, then not touched again.\n\n``` css\n.layer {\n--power-1-out: linear(\n    0 0%,\n    0.0027 3.64%,\n    0.0106 7.29%,\n    0.0425 14.58%,\n    0.0957 21.87%,\n    0.1701 29.16%,\n    0.2477 35.19%,\n    0.3401 41.23%,\n    0.5982 55.18%,\n    0.7044 61.56%,\n    0.7987 68.28%,\n    0.875 75%,\n    0.9297 81.25%,\n    0.9687 87.5%,\n    0.9922 93.75%,\n    1 100%\n  );\n}\n```\n\nHere are the animated layers showcasing both staggers.\n\nAnd here are the grid layers shown in DevTools\n\n---\n\nThat's it for your CSS implementation. There was mention of a JavaScript solution above. Without digging deep, this could be the [GreenSock ScrollTrigger](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) timeline for the center image. (You can wrap it in a support check like we did in the previous issue)\n\n``` css\ngsap\n  .timeline({\n    scrollTrigger: {\n      trigger: 'main section:first-of-type',\n      start: 'top -10%',\n      end: 'bottom 80%',\n      scrub: true,\n    },\n  })\n  .from(\n    '.scaler img',\n    {\n      height: window.innerHeight - 32,\n      ease: 'power1.inOut',\n    }\n  )\n  .from(\n    '.scaler img',\n    {\n      width: window.innerWidth - 32,\n      ease: 'power2.inOut',\n    },\n    0\n  )\n```\n\nYou create a GreenSock timeline and use the ScrollTrigger to drive it. That will work fine and you can adjust it as you wish. There is the potential that you may write more this way. An example is how you handled timing functions in the CSS for the scaling image.\n\n---\n\nLast things last, before we go. Remember option 1? How it's good to enhance as a bonus? Those little details? ʕ⊙ᴥ⊙ʔ\n\nUntil next time!\n\n---\n\n**Demo link: [codepen.io/jh3y](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/VYZwOwd/e336a907b7514f67b9eca281d625b774)  \nOn X: [x.com/jh3yy](https://x.com/jh3yy/status/1859789759167726065)  \nOn BlueSky: [bsky.app/jhey.dev](https://bsky.app/profile/jhey.dev/post/3lbiy7z6pek23)**","src/content/blog/_draft/241205-rabbit holes goes on forever.md","279b5ea7b011d368",{html:756,metadata:757},"<h1 id=\"scrolling-a-page-out-of-the-playbook-test\">Scrolling a page out of the Playbook (test)</h1>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-scroll-driven-gallery-effect-with-css\">Creating a scroll-driven gallery effect with CSS</h3>\n<p>In the past two issues, we’ve referenced CSS scroll-driven animations.

If a user scrolled our page and didn’t see it, they wouldn’t know unless they were looking for it. That said, let’s do option 3!</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-grid\">The Grid</h3>\n<p>First, you want to think about what elements you need to get this working. It’s a grid of images.</p>\n<p>When you look at the animation you’re trying to make, it’s as if layers of the grid move at different rates. The best path here is to split the grid into layers and have each layer use the same grid layout. Then you can animate each layer with different timing.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-html\" data-language=\"html\"><code is:raw=\"\" class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token

Written during the Qing dynasty by scholar Li Yuxiu, this classic text draws from the teachings of Confucius, emphasizing the importance of moral character, filial piety, and lifelong learning. With its concise three-character verses, *Di Zi Gui* has served as a foundational guide for generations, shaping the moral fabric of Chinese society and beyond.\n\nIn this blog, we'll explore the seven chapters of *Di Zi Gui*, uncovering its profound wisdom and practical lessons for living a meaningful and harmonious life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 1: At Home, Be Dutiful to My Parents (入則孝)**\n\nThe foundation of *Di Zi Gui* lies in filial piety, the virtue of respecting and caring for one's parents. Confucius believed that a person's moral character begins at home, and this chapter outlines how children should honor their parents in both words and actions. From responding promptly to their calls to ensuring their comfort and well-being, the text emphasizes the importance of humility, obedience, and gratitude. Even in moments of disagreement, children are encouraged to advise their parents with kindness and respect.\n\nThis chapter also addresses the deep reverence owed to parents, even after their passing. By observing mourning rituals and maintaining a disciplined life, children demonstrate their enduring love and respect. Filial piety, as taught in *Di Zi Gui*, is not just a duty but a profound expression of gratitude and love.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 2: Standards for Younger Brothers (and Juniors) When Away from Home (出則弟)**\n\nHarmony within the family extends to relationships with siblings and elders. This chapter teaches younger siblings to respect their elders and older siblings to care for their juniors. By fostering mutual respect and avoiding conflicts over material possessions, families can maintain peace and unity.\n\nThe text also provides guidelines for interacting with elders outside the home, such as addressing them respectfully, yielding to them in public spaces, and showing humility in their presence. These principles reinforce the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society built on respect and deference.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 3: Be Cautious (or Reverent) in My Daily Life (謹)**\n\nDaily habits and routines are a reflection of one's character. This chapter emphasizes the importance of discipline, cleanliness, and mindfulness in everyday life. From waking up early to maintaining personal hygiene and dressing modestly, the text encourages individuals to cultivate self-respect and order.\n\nThe chapter also advises against excess, whether in food, drink, or behavior. By practicing moderation and avoiding distractions, individuals can focus on self-improvement and moral growth. These teachings remind us that small, consistent actions contribute to a virtuous life.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 4: Be Trustworthy (信)**\n\nTrustworthiness is the cornerstone of all relationships. This chapter highlights the importance of honesty, integrity, and careful speech. It warns against deceit, gossip, and making promises lightly, urging individuals to think before they speak and act with sincerity.\n\nThe text also encourages self-reflection and accountability. When we make mistakes, we should acknowledge them and strive to improve. By cultivating trustworthiness, we build strong, lasting relationships and contribute to a more harmonious society.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 5: Love All Equally (泛愛眾)**\n\nConfucian philosophy extends the concept of love beyond the family to all of humanity. This chapter teaches us to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status or background. By avoiding arrogance, envy, and prejudice, we can foster a sense of unity and compassion.\n\nThe text also emphasizes the importance of helping others and resolving conflicts with reason rather than force. By practicing empathy and generosity, we create a world where everyone can thrive.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 6: Be Close to and Learn from People of Virtue and Compassion (親仁)**\n\nSurrounding ourselves with virtuous individuals is essential for personal growth. This chapter encourages us to seek out and learn from those who embody kindness, wisdom, and integrity. By associating with such people, we can improve our own character and avoid negative influences.\n\nThe text also warns against the dangers of associating with those who lack virtue, as their actions can lead us astray. Choosing our companions wisely is a key step on the path to moral excellence.\n\n---\n\n### **Chapter 7: After All the Above are Accomplished, I Should Study Further and Learn Literature and Art to Improve My Cultural and Spiritual Life (餘力學文)**\n\nThe final chapter of *Di Zi Gui* reminds us that moral development must be complemented by intellectual and cultural growth. While practicing virtue is essential, studying literature, art, and philosophy enriches our minds and spirits.\n\nThe text provides practical advice for effective learning, such as maintaining a clean and organized study space, focusing on one task at a time, and seeking clarification when in doubt. By balancing moral practice with intellectual pursuit, we can achieve a well-rounded and fulfilling life.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: The Enduring Relevance of *Di Zi Gui***\n\nThough written centuries ago, *Di Zi Gui* remains a powerful guide for living a virtuous and harmonious life. Its teachings on filial piety, respect, trustworthiness, and self-improvement are as relevant today as they were in ancient China. In a world that often prioritizes material success over moral character, *Di Zi Gui* reminds us of the timeless values that truly matter.\n\nBy incorporating the wisdom of *Di Zi Gui* into our daily lives, we can cultivate stronger relationships, contribute to a more harmonious society, and embark on a lifelong journey of personal growth.

With its concise three-character verses, <em>Di Zi Gui</em> has served as a foundational guide for generations, shaping the moral fabric of Chinese society and beyond.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we’ll explore the seven chapters of <em>Di Zi Gui</em>, uncovering its profound wisdom and practical lessons for living a meaningful and harmonious life.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-1-at-home-be-dutiful-to-my-parents-入則孝\"><strong>Chapter 1: At Home, Be Dutiful to My Parents (入則孝)</strong></h3>\n<p>The foundation of <em>Di Zi Gui</em> lies in filial piety, the virtue of respecting and caring for one’s parents. Confucius believed that a person’s moral character begins at home, and this chapter outlines how children should honor their parents in both words and actions. From responding promptly to their calls to ensuring their comfort and well-being, the text emphasizes the importance of humility, obedience, and gratitude. Even in moments of disagreement, children are encouraged to advise their parents with kindness and respect.</p>\n<p>This chapter also addresses the deep reverence owed to parents, even after their passing. By observing mourning rituals and maintaining a disciplined life, children demonstrate their enduring love and respect. Filial piety, as taught in <em>Di Zi Gui</em>, is not just a duty but a profound expression of gratitude and love.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-2-standards-for-younger-brothers-and-juniors-when-away-from-home-出則弟\"><strong>Chapter 2: Standards for Younger Brothers (and Juniors) When Away from Home (出則弟)</strong></h3>\n<p>Harmony within the family extends to relationships with siblings and elders. This chapter teaches younger siblings to respect their elders and older siblings to care for their juniors. By fostering mutual respect and avoiding conflicts over material possessions, families can maintain peace and unity.</p>\n<p>The text also provides guidelines for interacting with elders outside the home, such as addressing them respectfully, yielding to them in public spaces, and showing humility in their presence. These principles reinforce the Confucian ideal of a harmonious society built on respect and deference.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-3-be-cautious-or-reverent-in-my-daily-life-謹\"><strong>Chapter 3: Be Cautious (or Reverent) in My Daily Life (謹)</strong></h3>\n<p>Daily habits and routines are a reflection of one’s character. This chapter emphasizes the importance of discipline, cleanliness, and mindfulness in everyday life. From waking up early to maintaining personal hygiene and dressing modestly, the text encourages individuals to cultivate self-respect and order.</p>\n<p>The chapter also advises against excess, whether in food, drink, or behavior. By practicing moderation and avoiding distractions, individuals can focus on self-improvement and moral growth. These teachings remind us that small, consistent actions contribute to a virtuous life.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-4-be-trustworthy-信\"><strong>Chapter 4: Be Trustworthy (信)</strong></h3>\n<p>Trustworthiness is the cornerstone of all relationships. This chapter highlights the importance of honesty, integrity, and careful speech. It warns against deceit, gossip, and making promises lightly, urging individuals to think before they speak and act with sincerity.</p>\n<p>The text also encourages self-reflection and accountability. When we make mistakes, we should acknowledge them and strive to improve. By cultivating trustworthiness, we build strong, lasting relationships and contribute to a more harmonious society.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-5-love-all-equally-泛愛眾\"><strong>Chapter 5: Love All Equally (泛愛眾)</strong></h3>\n<p>Confucian philosophy extends the concept of love beyond the family to all of humanity. This chapter teaches us to treat everyone with kindness and respect, regardless of their social status or background. By avoiding arrogance, envy, and prejudice, we can foster a sense of unity and compassion.</p>\n<p>The text also emphasizes the importance of helping others and resolving conflicts with reason rather than force. By practicing empathy and generosity, we create a world where everyone can thrive.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-6-be-close-to-and-learn-from-people-of-virtue-and-compassion-親仁\"><strong>Chapter 6: Be Close to and Learn from People of Virtue and Compassion (親仁)</strong></h3>\n<p>Surrounding ourselves with virtuous individuals is essential for personal growth. This chapter encourages us to seek out and learn from those who embody kindness, wisdom, and integrity. By associating with such people, we can improve our own character and avoid negative influences.</p>\n<p>The text also warns against the dangers of associating with those who lack virtue, as their actions can lead us astray. Choosing our companions wisely is a key step on the path to moral excellence.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-7-after-all-the-above-are-accomplished-i-should-study-further-and-learn-literature-and-art-to-improve-my-cultural-and-spiritual-life-餘力學文\"><strong>Chapter 7: After All the Above are Accomplished, I Should Study Further and Learn Literature and Art to Improve My Cultural and Spiritual Life (餘力學文)</strong></h3>\n<p>The final chapter of <em>Di Zi Gui</em> reminds us that moral development must be complemented by intellectual and cultural growth. While practicing virtue is essential, studying literature, art, and philosophy enriches our minds and spirits.</p>\n<p>The text provides practical advice for effective learning, such as maintaining a clean and organized study space, focusing on one task at a time, and seeking clarification when in doubt. By balancing moral practice with intellectual pursuit, we can achieve a well-rounded and fulfilling life.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-the-enduring-relevance-of-di-zi-gui\"><strong>Conclusion: The Enduring Relevance of <em>Di Zi Gui</em></strong></h3>\n<p>Though written centuries ago, <em>Di Zi Gui</em> remains a powerful guide for living a virtuous and harmonious life. Its teachings on filial piety, respect, trustworthiness, and self-improvement are as relevant today as they were in ancient China. In a world that often prioritizes material success over moral character, <em>Di Zi Gui</em> reminds us of the timeless values that truly matter.</p>\n<p>By incorporating the wisdom of <em>Di Zi Gui</em> into our daily lives, we can cultivate stronger relationships, contribute to a more harmonious society, and embark on a lifelong journey of personal growth.

From the 1st millennium AD, the Malay Peninsula and the broader Indosphere became a vibrant zone of cultural exchange, where Indian traditions, art, religion, and cuisine left an indelible mark. This blog delves into the fascinating history of these early kingdoms, their connections with India and China, and their lasting legacy in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **The Dawn of Indian Influence in Southeast Asia**\n\nThe Malay Peninsula, often referred to as *Suvarnadvipa* (Golden Peninsula) in ancient Indian texts like the *Ramayana* and *Vayu Purana*, was a focal point of early trade and cultural exchange. By the 3rd century BC, Indian merchants and travelers had begun to establish connections with Southeast Asia, bringing with them Hinduism, Buddhism, and the Sanskrit language. These influences were further solidified during the 4th and 5th centuries under the South Indian Pallava dynasty, which played a key role in spreading Indian culture across the region.\n\nThe adoption of Hinduism and Buddhism by the people of the Malay Peninsula had a profound impact on their language, art, and societal structures. Sanskrit inscriptions dating back to the 4th century are evidence of this cultural synthesis, which laid the foundation for the region's early kingdoms.\n\n---\n\n### **Early Kingdoms of the Malay Peninsula (3rd–7th Centuries)**\n\nBy the 2nd and 3rd centuries, the Malay Peninsula was home to as many as 30 small kingdoms, many of which were located on the eastern coast. Among the earliest and most notable was **Langkasuka**, a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom believed to have been situated in the northern part of the peninsula. Langkasuka maintained close ties with **Funan**, a powerful kingdom in Cambodia that also exerted influence over parts of northern Malaysia.\n\nOther early polities included **Chi Tu**, **Pan Pan**, and the **Kingdom of Pahang**, all of which were mentioned in Chinese and Indian records. These kingdoms thrived on trade and cultural exchange, serving as important hubs for merchants traveling between India and China.\n\nOne of the most intriguing early kingdoms was **Gangga Negara**, a semi-legendary Hindu kingdom in present-day Perak, Malaysia. According to the *Malay Annals*, Gangga Negara was founded by Raja Gangga Shah Johan, a descendant of Alexander the Great or Khmer royalty. While its historical accuracy remains debated, Gangga Negara symbolizes the deep-rooted Indian influence in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **Trade and Cultural Exchange: The Lifeline of Early Kingdoms**\n\nThe Malay Peninsula's strategic location made it a crucial link in the maritime trade routes connecting China and India. Ptolemy, the Greek geographer, referred to the peninsula as the *Golden Chersonese*, highlighting its importance in ancient trade networks. Chinese pottery shards found in Borneo, dating back to the 1st century AD, attest to the early trade relations between the region and China.\n\nThe **Bujang Valley** in Kedah, with its Hindu temples and artifacts, stands as a testament to the vibrant trade and cultural exchange that took place. The valley, strategically located near the Strait of Malacca, was frequented by Indian and Chinese traders, leaving behind a rich archaeological legacy that includes sculptures, inscriptions, and monuments.\n\n---\n\n### **The Rise of Srivijaya (7th–13th Century)**\n\nBetween the 7th and 13th centuries, the **Srivijaya Empire** emerged as a dominant maritime power in Southeast Asia. Centered in Palembang, Sumatra, Srivijaya controlled much of the Malay Peninsula and the surrounding archipelago. The empire was built on trade, with local kings (dhatus) swearing allegiance to the Srivijayan Maharajas for mutual benefit.\n\nSrivijaya's influence extended far and wide, from the Malay Peninsula to parts of Java and Borneo. The empire's wealth and power were derived from its control over key trade routes and its ability to levy taxes on passing ships. However, Srivijaya's dominance began to wane in the 11th century due to conflicts with the **Chola Empire** of South India and the rise of competing powers like **Majapahit**.\n\n---\n\n### **The Chola Invasion and Its Aftermath**\n\nThe relationship between Srivijaya and the Chola Empire was initially friendly, but tensions escalated during the reign of **Rajendra Chola I**. In 1025, the Cholas launched a series of invasions, targeting Srivijaya's vassal states like **Kedah** (known as Kadaram in Tamil) and **Gangga Negara**. These invasions significantly weakened Srivijaya's hold over the region.\n\nThe Chola expeditions left a lasting impression on the Malay people, as evidenced by references to the Chola kings in the *Sejarah Melayu* (Malay Annals). Even today, the legacy of the Cholas is remembered in Malaysia, with many royal names bearing the suffix *Cholan* or *Chulan*.\n\n---\n\n### **Decline and the Rise of New Powers**\n\nBy the 12th century, Srivijaya's power had declined due to internal strife, external invasions, and the spread of Islam. The rise of the **Majapahit Empire** in Java and the expansion of the **Siamese Kingdom** further eroded Srivijaya's influence. By the late 13th century, much of the Malay Peninsula had come under Siamese control.\n\nThe final chapter of Srivijaya's legacy was written in the 14th century when **Sang Nila Utama**, a Srivijaya prince, founded the **Kingdom of Singapura** (Temasek). Although short-lived, Singapura laid the groundwork for the rise of the **Sultanate of Malacca** in the early 15th century, which became the next great Malay political entity in the region.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion: A Legacy That Endures**\n\nThe early Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia played a pivotal role in shaping the region's cultural and historical landscape. From the spread of Indian religions and scripts to the establishment of powerful maritime empires like Srivijaya, these kingdoms were at the heart of a vibrant network of trade and cultural exchange.\n\nToday, the legacy of these early kingdoms can be seen in the region's architecture, language, and traditions. The Bujang Valley, the ruins of Srivijaya, and the stories of Sang Nila Utama remind us of a time when the Malay Peninsula was a crossroads of civilizations, where the cultures of India, China, and Southeast Asia converged to create a unique and enduring heritage.\n\nWhether you're a history enthusiast or a curious traveler, exploring the remnants of these early kingdoms offers a fascinating glimpse into the rich tapestry of Southeast Asia's past.","src/content/blog/2025/250323-malaysia-past.md","bcd62011971182a1",{html:1000,metadata:1001},"<h1 id=\"exploring-the-early-hindu-buddhist-kingdoms-of-southeast-asia-a-journey-through-greater-indias-cultural-legacy\">Exploring the Early Hindu-Buddhist Kingdoms of Southeast Asia: A Journey Through Greater India’s Cultural Legacy</h1>\n<p>source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Malaysia\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Malaysia</a></p>\n<p>The history of Southeast Asia is deeply intertwined with the cultural, religious, and political influences of early Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms.

But what exactly are shaders, and how can one approach them, especially using a friendly tool like P5.js? This blog aims to demystify shaders and provide a roadmap for beginners eager to explore this fascinating aspect of creative coding.\n\n## Understanding Shaders: The Basics\n\n### Shaders: The Digital Paintbrush\n\nShaders are small programs written in a specific shading language, such as GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language). They run on the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and determine how pixels on the screen are rendered. In simple terms, shaders are the tools that tell your computer how to display graphics, creating effects ranging from simple color changes to complex motion graphics.\n\n## Approaching Shaders with P5.js\n\n### Why P5.js?\nP5.js, a JavaScript library, is an excellent gateway into the world of shaders. It's designed for artists and beginners, making it more accessible than other programming environments. P5.js simplifies the implementation of shaders, allowing you to focus on creativity rather than getting bogged down by technical details.\n\nThere are other library such as pixi.js which capable of handling shaders, but it geared towards developers well-versed in programming, offering a fast and flexible 2D WebGL renderer suitable for developing rich, interactive graphics and games.\n## Key Concepts in Shaders\n\n### 1. Vertex and Fragment Shaders\n- **Vertex Shaders:** Determine the position of vertices in 3D space.\n- **Fragment Shaders:** Also known as pixel shaders, they define the color, texture, and depth of pixels.\n### 2. GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)\nThe programming language used to write shaders, offering a wide range of functions for mathematical and graphical operations.\n### 3. Uniforms, Varyings, and Attributes\nThese are types of variables in GLSL, each serving different purposes in shader programming.\n\n## A Glossary for the Shader Novice\n\n1. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** \n   Hardware that executes rendering, calculation, and processing of graphics.\n2. **Rendering:** \n   The process of generating an image from a model using computer programs.\n3. **Texture:** \n   A bitmap image applied to the surface in 3D graphics.\n4. **Coordinate System:** \n   The system in GLSL that helps in positioning and transforming vertices.\n5. **Fragment:** \n   A term used in fragment shaders, referring to the data needed to render a single pixel.\n6. **WebGL:** \n   A JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.\n\n## Practical Steps to Start with Shaders in P5.js\n\n1. **Setup P5.js Environment:** \n   Ensure you have the P5.js library set up in your coding environment.\n2. **Understand Basic Shapes and Colors:** \n   Start with simple P5.js sketches to get a feel for drawing and coloring.\n3. **Introduction to GLSL:** \n   Learn the basics of GLSL, focusing on syntax and basic constructs.\n4. **Experiment with Simple Shaders:** \n   Start by creating simple fragment shaders to change colors or textures.\n5. **Progress to More Complex Shaders:** \n   Gradually move to more complex shaders involving lighting, texture mapping, and other effects.\n6. **Explore and Experiment:** \n   The key to mastering shaders is experimentation. Play around with code, break things, and learn from your mistakes.\n\n## Next: Your Journey into Shaders Begins\n\nShaders are a blend of art and science, requiring both creative vision and technical skills. With P5.js, you have a user-friendly tool at your fingertips to start this exciting journey. Remember, the world of shaders is vast and complex, but with patience and practice, you can unlock its full potential. \n\nFor more you can give these video a watch first.\n\n[![An introduction to Shader Art Coding](http://img.youtube.com/vi/f4s1h2YETNY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY \"An introduction to Shader Art Coding\")\n\n[![# Introduction to shaders: Learn the basics!](http://img.youtube.com/vi/3mfvZ-mdtZQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mfvZ-mdtZQ \"Introduction to shaders: Learn the basics!\")","src/content/blog/2025/Unlocking the World of Shaders with P5.js - A Beginner's Guide.md","e0f02adb8c4c5a90",{html:1293,metadata:1294},"<h2 id=\"introduction-the-mystical-world-of-shaders\">Introduction: The Mystical World of Shaders</h2>\n<p>In the realm of digital art and game development, shaders are often mentioned with a mix of awe and mystery.

Web Component Demo\n\nThis is a sample sketch demonstrating the sketches feature. \nIn a real sketch, you would include more detailed content and possibly embed interactive components.\n\n```html\n<!-- Example HTML component -->\n<div class=\"interactive-component\">\n  <h2>Interactive Component</h2>\n  <button id=\"demo-button\">Click Me!</button>\n  <div id=\"output\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n/* Example CSS */\n.interactive-component {\n  padding: 20px;\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  margin-top: 20px;\n}\n\n#demo-button {\n  background: #0070f3;\n  color: white;\n  border: none;\n  padding: 8px 16px;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n#demo-button:hover {\n  background: #005cdd;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example JavaScript\ndocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {\n  const button = document.getElementById('demo-button');\n  const output = document.getElementById('output');\n  \n  let clickCount = 0;\n  \n  button.addEventListener('click', () => {\n    clickCount++;\n    output.textContent = `Button clicked ${clickCount} time${clickCount === 1 ? '' : 's'}!`;\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## How This Works\n\nIn a real sketch, you might include explanations of your code, implementation details, or design decisions.\nYou can also embed interactive components from your components directory.\n\nFor example, if you had a component at `src/components/sketches/DemoComponent.vue`, you could import and use it like this:\n\n```jsx\nimport DemoComponent from '@components/sketches/DemoComponent.vue';\n\n<DemoComponent />\n```","src/content/sketches/webdev/2025/250417-sample-sketch.mdx","237eced8b8f6835d"];
