        Companies like Apple are making design impossible for startups to
        ignore. Startups like <a href="#">Github</a>, <a href="#">Airbnb</a>, <a
          href="#">Square</a
        >, and <a href="#">Fitbit</a> have design at the core of their business,
        and they're doing phenomenal work. But what is 'design' actually? Is it a
        logo? A Wordpress theme? An innovative UI?
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        It's so much more than that. It's a state of mind. It's an approach to a
        problem. It's how you're going to kick your competitor's ass. This handy
        guide will help you understand design and provide resources to help you
        find awesome design talent.

        <p>
          The simplest definition. Design is so many things, executed in many
          different ways, but the function is always the same. Whether it's
          blueprints, a clever UI, a brochure, or a chair – design can help
          solve a visual or physical problem.¹

          So what is "good design"?
        </h2>
        <p>
          This definition is not so simple. The best designs are notorious for
          seeming not designed at all – or <span class="highlight"
            >'undesigned'</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's easier if we break things down a bit. If you know what to look
          for, it's easier to identify good design when you see it, or perhaps <span
            class="highlight">when you can't see it at all</span
          >.

          Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer <span class="highlight"

          > and functionalist industrial design.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to <a href="#">Vitsœ</a>: Back in the early 1980s, aware
          that his design was a significant contributor to the world, he asked
          himself an important question: <span class="italic"
            >"Is my design good design?"</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Since good design can't be measured in a finite way, he set about
          expressing the ten most important principles for what he considered
          was good design. (Sometimes they are referred as the 'Ten
          commandments'.) Here they are.²

            Take a look at your current product – is design contributing in an
            innovative way? Does it make the product useful, understandable, and
            aesthetic? Is it long-lasting, or will it look outdated or break in

            These are really hard questions to answer. Designers enable you to

            This is a term that describes an array of different kinds of
            designers. Think of it like the term 'entrepreneur'. It describes a
            wide variety of businesspeople - from founders to VCs to <span
              class="highlight">"Chief Ninjas"</span
            > - but isn't all-inclusive. Graphic designers work with graphical images,
            whether they be illustrations, <span class="highlight"
              >typography</span
            >, or images, and on a variety of media including print and web.
            Graphic design is typically rendered in 2D – printed on a physical
            surface or displayed on a screen.

          <p class="text-sm">
            A type of graphic designer that works exclusively with print media.
            Before the widespread adoption of computers, software, and the web,
            virtually all graphic designers worked on print media such as
            posters, magazines, billboards, and books. Print designers are
            typically masters of typography, illustration, and traditional
            printing processes like the <span class="highlight"
              >Linotype machine</span
            > or the
            <span class="highlight">letterpress machine</span>, a 500-year-old
            printing method that has regained popularity in recent years for its
            handmade and traditional feel.

        <p>
          Interaction designers, on the other hand, focus on digital products

          be observed, interaction design helps humans experience or manipulate
          software or interface with screen-based hardware in order to <span

            User Experience (UX) design "incorporates aspects of psychology,
            anthropology, sociology, computer science, graphic design,
            industrial design and cognitive science. Depending on the purpose of
            the product, UX may also involve content design disciplines such as

            The goal of UX design is to create a seamless, simple, and useful
            interaction between a user and a product, whether it be hardware or

            creating interactions designed to meet or assist a user's goals and
