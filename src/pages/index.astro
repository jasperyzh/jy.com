    number: "05",
    title: "Unobtrusive",
    description:
      "Good design is unobtrusive. Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained.",

    description:
      "Good design is honest. It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with promises that cannot be kept.",
  },

    number: "07",
    title: "Long-lasting",
    description:
      "Good design is long-lasting. It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today's throwaway society.",
  },
  {
    number: "08",

      "Good design is thorough down to the last detail. Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process show respect towards the user.",

    number: "09",
    title: "Environmentally-friendly",

    title: "As little design as possible",
    description:
      "Good design is as little design as possible. Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity.",

            Welcome to my digital space. I'm Jasper Yong, a developer and
            designer exploring the intersection of technology, aesthetics, and
            problem-solving. This site serves as my personal hub – a collection
            of projects, technical writings from my notes, and experiments in
            creative coding.

          Dieter Rams' Ten Principles

        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
          Back in the early 1980s, Dieter Rams asked himself an important
          question: "Is my design good design?" Since good design can't be
          measured in a finite way, he set about expressing the ten most
          important principles for what he considered was good design.
