## Project Overview

Spearheaded the technical development for the viral 'BersatuForMakan' campaign, a collaborative effort with BFM 89.9. The campaign aimed to highlight Malaysia's rich culinary heritage. My role involved designing and building a dedicated microsite from concept to launch to serve as the central hub for the campaign.

### Key Achievements & Impact

*   Led the technical execution and development of the campaign's core online presence (the microsite).
*   Achieved exceptional viral results on a remarkably modest RM2000 budget.
*   The campaign reached nearly 3 million people and generated an estimated RM700k in earned media value.
*   Drove a significant 628% increase in campaign engagement and sixfold follower growth for the partner organization (BFM 89.9).
*   The microsite played a key role in the campaign's overall success and visibility.

### Technologies & Tools

*   WordPress (CMS)
