## Project Overview

This project involved the comprehensive revamp and ongoing maintenance of the official Yayasan PETRONAS Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) platform. The primary goal was to create a more engaging and transparent online presence to enhance the visibility of their social initiatives and increase donor engagement.

### My Role & Contributions

*   **Platform Vision & Development Lead:** Spearheaded the technical development and implementation of a completely new CSR platform for Yayasan PETRONAS, translating their vision for an engaging and transparent online presence into a functional reality. The primary objective was to effectively manage substantial content, enhance the visibility of social initiatives, and boost donor engagement.
*   **UI/UX Implementation:** Led the front-end and back-end development based on the proposed UI/UX designs, ensuring the platform was both visually compelling and intuitive for users navigating complex information.
*   **Cross-Team Collaboration & Technical Growth:** Worked closely with the client's internal IT team to successfully deploy the website onto their Red Hat Enterprise Linux server environment. This collaboration marked a significant learning step for me, representing my initial hands-on experience managing deployments via terminal commands and SSH.
*   **High-Profile Launch & Impact:** Played a key role in the team effort leading to the successful and high-profile launch of the website, an event inaugurated by Dr. Wan Azizah, signifying the project's importance.
*   **Sustained Maintenance & Content Strategy:** Established and executed a long-term maintenance plan spanning several years. This involved consistently updating content, including crucial annual reports and frequent press releases, and continuing collaboration with the client's IT team to address server-side requirements via SSH, ensuring the platform's ongoing relevance and reliability.

### Technologies & Tools

*   WordPress (CMS, PHP)
