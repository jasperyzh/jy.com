## Project Overview

Developed a central online hub for Methodist College Kuala Lumpur (MCKL) and its Pykett-Penang campus. This platform serves to promote their programs for further studies, provide essential information, and facilitate inquiries from prospective students and parents.

### My Role & Contributions

*   **Collaborative Reimagining & Modernization:** Engaged closely with MCKL stakeholders from the outset to understand their vision and challenges with the legacy system. Led the initiative to modernize their online presence, opting for a full WordPress rebuild to establish a robust and future-proof foundation.

*   **User-Centric Design & Information Architecture:** Focused on creating an intuitive user experience (UI/UX) by redesigning the interface and streamlining the presentation and categorization of academic programs. This involved careful content migration and structuring information for clarity.

*   **Lead Generation & System Integration:** Implemented effective lead capture forms integrated with Zoho CRM, establishing a reliable pipeline for inquiries and ensuring seamless data flow for the admissions team. Provided ongoing management to confirm system integrity.

*   **Scalable Architecture & Expansion:** As MCKL expanded, architected and deployed a WordPress Multisite solution to efficiently launch and manage a dedicated site for the new Penang branch, demonstrating the scalability of the core platform.

*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration & Reliability:** Served as a key technical point of contact, proactively collaborating with the client's internal IT department and third-party server vendors to troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and ensure the website's consistent availability and smooth operation.

*   **Agile Campaign Support & KPI Focus:** Developed and maintained responsive microsites and updated core website content to support time-sensitive marketing initiatives like Open Days and special recruitment events, directly contributing to meeting the client's key performance indicators (KPIs).

*   **Technology Evolution & Workflow Optimization:** Initially utilized Nuxt.js for rapid microsite deployment. Recognizing opportunities to enhance efficiency, strategically migrated these sites to Astro.js. This move significantly reduced technical overhead, accelerated the content update process, and lessened the long-term maintenance burden.

*   **Long-Term Partnership & Sustained Operation:** Cultivated a strong, multi-year relationship built on trust and reliability. Established effective maintenance workflows that ensured the platform's stability and continuous improvement over several years.

### Technologies & Tools

*   **Content Management System (CMS):** WordPress (including Multisite functionality)
*   **Frontend Frameworks (Microsites):** Nuxt.js (initially), Astro.js (migration for efficiency)
*   **Customer Relationship Management (CRM):** Zoho CRM (for lead capture and management)
*   **Core Web Technologies:** PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
*   **Infrastructure:** Collaboration with client's IT and third-party server vendors for hosting and maintenance.
