# Mesh Gradient

This sketch creates a smooth, animated mesh gradient using interpolation between control points. The implementation subdivides between color control points to create a continuous color field.

<div class="interactive-component">
  <MeshGradientSketch />
</div>

## How It Works

1. The code defines a grid of control points, each with position coordinates and RGB color values
2. The grid is subdivided into a finer mesh by interpolating between the control points
3. Animation is applied by slightly shifting the control points with sine waves
4. Each cell of the subdivided grid is drawn as a rectangle with the interpolated color

## Implementation

The sketch uses canvas-sketch for managing the animation loop and canvas setup. The main algorithm:

1. Define a grid of control points with colors
2. For each frame, animate the control points with a sine wave
3. Interpolate the grid into a finer mesh using bilinear interpolation
4. Draw each cell of the mesh as a colored rectangle
