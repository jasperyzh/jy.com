# Generative Grids

This sketch explores recursive binary space partitioning to create aesthetically pleasing grid layouts. The algorithm divides space into smaller and smaller rectangles, creating a dynamic composition that balances between order and randomness.

## Features

- **Golden Ratio Aesthetics**: Uses the golden ratio (1.618) for color relationships and proportions
- **Recursive Partitioning**: Employs binary space partitioning with minimum size constraints
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Automatically adapts to different screen sizes
- **Interactive**: Click anywhere to generate a new composition

The visual style is inspired by modernist design principles, with clean lines and a warm color palette. Each tile is rendered with subtle shadows to create a sense of depth and dimension.

Try clicking on the canvas to generate new compositions. Each layout is unique, demonstrating how simple recursive rules can create complex and visually interesting patterns.
