## Unveiling the Beauty of Order: Poisson-Disc Sampling Explained

-> Reference: [Jason Davies's interactive demo](https://www.jasondavies.com/poisson-disc/)

Ever looked at points scattered randomly and felt something was... off? Simple random distributions often lead to ugly clumps and large empty areas. If you need points that are distributed randomly but maintain a certain minimum distance from each other – think placing trees in a forest, generating texture details, or distributing objects in a scene – you need something more sophisticated. Enter **Poisson-Disc Sampling (PDS)**.

<PoissonDiscSampling />

**What is Poisson-Disc Sampling?**

Poisson-Disc Sampling is a technique for generating points in a space (like a 2D plane or a 3D volume) such that:

1.  **Minimum Distance:** No two points are closer to each other than a specified minimum distance, `r`. Imagine each point having a small "exclusion disc" of radius `r/2` around it – no two discs can overlap.
2.  **Random Distribution:** Subject to the minimum distance constraint, the points should appear randomly distributed, without forming obvious grid-like patterns.
3.  **Tight Packing:** The algorithm aims to place points as densely as possible without violating the minimum distance rule.

The result is a distribution that looks much more natural and uniform than simple random sampling, often referred to as "blue noise" due to its characteristics in frequency space (it lacks low-frequency energy, which corresponds to clumping).

*(Imagine comparing two images here: one with simple random points showing clumps, and one with PDS showing uniform-but-random spacing)*

**Why Not Just Scatter and Check?**

A naive approach might be:
1. Generate a random point.
2. Check its distance to *all* previously placed points.
3. If it's far enough from all of them, keep it.
4. Repeat until you have enough points or can't place any more.

This works, but it's slow! Checking against every previous point makes it an O(n²) algorithm, which becomes computationally expensive very quickly as the number of points (`n`) grows.

**Bridson's Algorithm: The Fast O(n) Approach**

Robert Bridson developed a clever algorithm that achieves Poisson-Disc Sampling in linear time, O(n). This makes it highly practical even for large numbers of points. Here's the core idea:

1.  **Spatial Grid:** Imagine overlaying a grid onto your sampling area. The key insight is to choose a cell size small enough that *each grid cell can contain at most one valid sample point*. A cell size of `r / sqrt(2)` (for 2D) works perfectly. This grid acts as an acceleration structure.
2.  **Active List:** Maintain a list of "active" points. These are points that have been placed but might still have space around them to generate new valid neighbors.
3.  **Process:**
    *   Start with one random point placed in the grid and added to the active list.
    *   While the active list is not empty:
        *   Pick a random point (`P`) from the active list.
        *   Try generating `k` candidate points randomly within an annulus (a ring) between distance `r` and `2r` around `P`. (Why `k` attempts? It's a trade-off; 30 is a common value. Too few might miss valid spots; too many wastes time).
        *   For each candidate point (`C`):
            *   **Check Bounds:** Is `C` inside the sampling area?
            *   **Check Proximity (The Fast Part):** Instead of checking *all* existing points, only check points in the neighboring grid cells around `C`. Because of the grid cell size, if any point is too close (`< r`), it *must* be in one of these nearby cells. This proximity check is now very fast (effectively O(1)).
            *   If `C` is valid (within bounds and not too close to neighbors):
                *   Add `C` to the list of samples.
                *   Add `C` to the grid.
                *   Add `C` to the active list (it might generate neighbors later).
                *   Stop generating candidates for `P` (move on to the next active point).
        *   If, after `k` attempts, no valid candidate was found around `P`:
            *   Remove `P` from the active list (it's considered "finished" – no more room around it).
    *   The algorithm terminates when the active list is empty, meaning no more points can be placed according to the rules.

**Why the Annulus (`r` to `2r`)?**
Generating candidates *exactly* at distance `r` might work, but searching in the annulus `r` to `2r` gives more flexibility and increases the chances of finding a valid spot quickly, especially in denser areas.

**Parameters:**

*   `r`: The minimum distance. Controls the density of points. Smaller `r` means more points.
*   `k`: The number of candidate points to try around each active point before giving up on it. Higher `k` is more thorough but slightly slower.

**Conclusion**

Bridson's algorithm provides an elegant and efficient way to generate high-quality, natural-looking point distributions. Its O(n) performance makes it suitable for a wide range of applications in graphics, procedural generation, simulation, and data visualization where both randomness and spatial separation are desired.

## p5.js Sketch: Visualizing Bridson's Algorithm

This sketch implements Bridson's algorithm and visualizes the process.

*   **White points:** Final, accepted samples.
*   **Yellow points:** Points currently in the "active" list.
*   **Green circle (optional):** Shows the annulus search area around the currently processed active point.
*   **Red points (optional):** Invalid candidates that were rejected.

```

**How to Run the Sketch:**

1.  Go to the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
2.  Paste the code into the editor.
3.  Press the "Play" button (▶).

You should see points gradually appearing on the canvas, respecting the minimum distance rule. Active points (yellow) will generate new points until they are surrounded, at which point they turn white and are removed from the active list. The process stops when no active points remain. Click the mouse to restart the sampling process. You can uncomment the `keyPressed` function or add sliders/buttons to control visualization options and the minimum distance `r`.
