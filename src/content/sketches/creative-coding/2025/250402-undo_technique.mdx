# Simple Drawing with Undo/Redo

This sketch demonstrates a simple drawing application with undo/redo functionality. It implements a custom undo stack that can track and reverse drawing actions.

<div class="interactive-component">
  <UndoTechniqueSketch />
</div>

## How It Works

1. The application uses a canvas element for drawing
2. Each stroke is recorded as a series of points
3. The undo stack tracks each stroke as a complete action
4. Undo/redo operations can add or remove entire strokes

## Implementation Details

The sketch uses a custom undo stack implementation that:

1. Maintains separate stacks for past and future actions
2. Clones action data to prevent mutation issues
3. Provides clean undo/redo operations
4. Handles both mouse and touch input

## Key Features

- Simple and efficient undo/redo implementation
- Touch device support
- Clean state management
- Visual feedback for available undo/redo actions
