import VimTypingGame from "./250514-vim-typing-game.astro";

<VimTypingGame />

using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a simple typing game that uses the Vim keybindings.

like Mario Typing Game, its more an exercise web app game to practice vim motions.

so it displays a text and the user has to type the text in the correct order.
 
for examples: h j k l

user have to go back and forth between j and k, going up and down like jumping jack.

then user have to dodge the obstacles with h and l.
