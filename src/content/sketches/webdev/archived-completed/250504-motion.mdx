## The Spark: Synchronized Motion... with CSS Grid?

I stumbled upon this really slick animation ([https://www.instagram.com/p/DJKbriGC6Mk/](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJKbriGC6Mk/)). 
What struck me was the multiple elements moving in unison, ordered sequence. It looked complex but incredibly smooth. 

It made me realize that most of my animation work so far has been pretty basic – making individual element fade-in & slide-up. I have not been tackled animating a group in unison, while back in my mind I had some ideas of how to approach it, but never really sat down to do it.

Also... does it work with CSS Grid?

## In comes [Motion One](https://motion.dev/)

My first thought for complex animation might typically be GSAP, but I could not pass the chance of using a library where it levelaged on native Web Animation API  (WAAPI)—basically lightweight, native, and browser-supported— I came across [Motion One](https://motion.dev/) by chance through a podcast [by Syntax with Matt Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6oXsC1gGHc)

## Building the Blocks (and Boxes)

I pretty much skim through the docs and examples, and then just copy/paste some samples to get started.


The goal was clear: 
1. get an element to move from one point to another using CSS Grid for composition.

2. get a group of elements moving together, each transitioning into different positions at set intervals. For now each box will randomly move to a new position, but never step on the position of fellow boxes.

3. get a group moves loop through state with predetermined patterns, then loop through these states continuously.

Bonus: Add controls to play, pause (even mid-transition!), and reset the animation smoothly back to a starting grid.


## Reality Check and Vibe Check

Just as I was getting the boxes moving, I randomly bumped into this absolutely wild motion graphics piece.

The sheer amount of detail, the glitchy aesthetic, the complexity – it was insane. Seeing work like that can be a bit discouraging when you're still, quite literally, animating boxes on a screen.

But hey, comparison is the thief of joy, right? While I'm not shredding intricate movie-level motion graphics (yet!), I managed to *vibe* out exactly what I set out to do. The boxes move in sync, hit their predetermined spots, loop through states, and respond to controls. 

Motion One proved capable, and the core challenge was met. It's a solid foundation for more complex sequenced animations down the line. To be able to adjust the CSS Grid layout, resizing the container and see the animation update in real-time was a huge win.

For now, this experiment was a success. Keep Going!
