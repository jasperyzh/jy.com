# Perfect Loop Sin Cosine

<PerfectLoopSinCosine />

A sketch I did back in 2020 during the pandemic.

Idea came from what kind of pattern does the lines make, when it drawn from one point to another point, and those points are moving in a crazy pattern and angles, but still follow a rhythmic rotating pattern using `sin` and `cos`.
