# AI Agent Memory Bank System

## Overview

### Purpose
The Memory Bank system provides AI agents with structured, persistent project context using Markdown files, dramatically improving their consistency, accuracy, and adherence to project standards across sessions.

### Problem Solved
AI assistants typically lose context between sessions or during long conversations. The Memory Bank creates a "persistent brain" for the project that can be referenced anytime.

### Core Concept
A set of specialized Markdown files containing key project information (the "Memory Bank") that both humans and AI can read, reference, and update as part of the development workflow.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the Directory Structure

Choose a location for your Memory Bank files:
- Option A: `/src/content/docs/memory-bank/` (preferred for documentation sites)
- Option B: `.cursor/memory-bank/` (for projects without doc sites)
- Option C: Project root with `MEMORY_BANK.md` as an index

### Step 2: Create the Core Files

Create these essential Markdown files:

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `00-ai-instructions.md` | Instructions for AI agents | As needed |
| `01-project-brief.md` | Core goals & constraints | Quarterly |
| `02-product-context.md` | Why & UX goals | Monthly |
| `03-active-context.md` | Current focus & decisions | Weekly |
| `04-system-patterns.md` | Architecture & patterns | When patterns change |
| `05-tech-context.md` | Stack & environment | When dependencies change |
| `06-progress.md` | Status tracking | Weekly |

Optional files:
- `project-rules.md` - Learned conventions and preferences
- Domain-specific files (e.g., `api-specs.md`, `testing-strategy.md`)

### Step 3: Populate the Files

Each file follows a standard format:
```markdown
# [TITLE]
<!-- [MAINTENANCE INSTRUCTION] -->

## [Section]
```[machine-readable-tag]
- [Content]
```

Example templates are available in the next section.

### Step 4: Integrate with AI Workflow

When working with AI assistants:

1. **Start tasks with context**: 
   ```
   @00-ai-instructions.md I need help with [task]. Please refer to 
   @05-tech-context.md and @04-system-patterns.md as needed.
   ```

2. **Refresh context when needed**:
   ```
   Please review the Memory Bank files again, particularly @03-active-context.md
   ```

3. **Request updates**:
   ```
   Please update the Memory Bank to reflect these changes, particularly 
   in @06-progress.md and @03-active-context.md
   ```

4. **Maintain consistency check**:
   AI responses should include "Yes, Chef!" to confirm they've read and are following instructions.

### Step 5: Maintain the Memory Bank

Keep information current through:

1. **Regular reviews**: Schedule weekly reviews of `active-context.md` and `progress.md`
2. **Post-implementation updates**: After completing features or making architectural decisions
3. **Trigger words**: Use `update memory bank` as a command to instruct AI to update relevant files
4. **Lock critical content**: Use HTML comments to protect sections:
   ```markdown
   <!-- LOCKED CONTENT - DO NOT MODIFY -->
   - Critical rule one
   - Critical rule two
   <!-- END LOCKED CONTENT -->
   ```

## Template Examples

### Project Brief Template
```markdown
# PROJECT BRIEF
<!-- Update quarterly or after major pivots -->

## Core Identity
```immutable
- Codename: [PROJECT_NAME]
- Type: [WEB_APP/MOBILE/SERVICE]
- Legacy Status: [GREENFIELD/BROWNFIELD]
```

## Strategic Goals (Q[X] 202[X])
```goals
1. [ ] Primary: [Strategic_Objective_1]
   - Success Metric: [KPI]
2. [ ] Secondary: [Strategic_Objective_2]
```

## Absolute Constraints
<!-- LOCKED SECTION - PM MUST APPROVE CHANGES -->
- Never: [Non-Negotiable_1]
- Always: [Non-Negotiable_2]
```

### Active Context Template
```markdown
# ACTIVE CONTEXT
<!-- DAILY UPDATES REQUIRED -->

## Current Focus (YYYY-MM-DD)
```focus-area
- Sprint Goal: [Objective]
- Blockers: 
  - [ ] [Blocker_1] @[Owner]
  - [x] [Resolved_Blocker]
```

## Recent Decisions
```decision-log
| Date | Decision | Impact | Owner |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Technical_Choice] | [Modules_Affected] | @[Who] |
```

## Immediate Todos
```hotlist
1. [High] [Critical_Task] → ETA: [When]
2. [Med] [Important_Task] → Depends On: [Dependency]
```
```

## Benefits & Best Practices

### Key Advantages
- **Continuity**: AI retains knowledge between sessions and different assistants
- **Standardization**: Enforces consistent architecture and coding styles
- **Documentation**: Creates living documentation that serves humans and AI
- **Efficiency**: Reduces repetitive explanations of project basics
- **Adaptation**: Captures evolving conventions and preferences

### Best Practices
1. **Start simple**: Begin with just 2-3 key files and expand as needed
2. **Be explicit**: Use clear, consistent structure with machine-readable sections
3. **Version awareness**: Include timestamps and change logs
4. **Visual hierarchy**: Use status indicators ([75%], [High]) for clarity
5. **Regular maintenance**: Schedule time to update files after major changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **AI ignores instructions**: Restart chat with explicit reference to Memory Bank files
- **Context overload**: Keep Memory Bank files concise; split into smaller files if needed
- **Stale information**: Set calendar reminders for regular reviews

### Advanced Usage
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Auto-update progress tracking
- **Linking to Obsidian**: Maintain equivalent files in Obsidian for personal reference
- **Custom tools**: Build script automation to assist with maintenance
