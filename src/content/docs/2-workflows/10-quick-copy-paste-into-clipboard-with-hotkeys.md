I have 2 hotkeys to that copy text right into the clipboard ready to use:

1. current date YYMMDD - as i use it daily for my file naming or notetaking, to avoid typing repetitive numbers..
2. Summary Instructions for AI chatbot - another copy/paste that i constantly find myself using often, in case the platform does not accept pre-instructions or great memory, its handy to have a prompt to be copy with hotkey

general flow (table comparison)
1. type it out, OR go to note
2. open note
3. highlight
4. copy
5. switch back to task windows
6. select field
7. paste

vs 
1. use hotkeys
2. select field
3. paste



here how you can do it via ubuntu, windows, or browser extension
