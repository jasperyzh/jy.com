# Server Setup Guide

## Shared Hosting

Shared hosting has been my traditional deployment method for many years:

- Setting up cPanel environments
- FTP file management workflows
- Database configuration (MySQL)
- Domain and subdomain management
- SSL certificate implementation

## Modern Deployment with Vercel

Recently, I've transitioned to Vercel for most projects:

- Zero-configuration deployments
- GitHub integration for CI/CD
- Environment variables management
- Custom domain setup
- Serverless functions implementation
- Analytics and performance monitoring

## Docker Exploration

I'm currently learning Docker for more complex deployments:

- Container basics and architecture
- Docker Compose for multi-container apps
- Image building and optimization
- Volume management for persistent data
- Networking between containers
- Deployment strategies
