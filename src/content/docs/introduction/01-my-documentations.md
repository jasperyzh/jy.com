# My Documentations

Welcome to my documentation! This guide is mainly for my own reference, and hopefully help any soul that stumble upon here.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript

## Installation

You can install our package using npm:

```bash
npm install our-package
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn add our-package
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use our package:

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'our-package';

const app = createApp({
  // configuration options
  debug: true,
  theme: 'light'
});

app.start();
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've installed the package, check out these guides:
