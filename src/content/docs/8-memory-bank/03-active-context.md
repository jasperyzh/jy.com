## Recent Decisions

| 2024-04-13 | Use SVG for thumbnail generation instead of Canvas/p5.js | Eliminated native dependencies, simplified build process | @matsu |
| 2024-04-13 | Implement format priority system (svg < jpg < jpeg < webp < png) | More flexible image format handling | @matsu |
| 2024-04-13 | Organize thumbnails by collection (/thumbnails/[collection]/[slug]) | Better organization, follows content structure | @matsu |
| 2024-04-13 | Use build-time generation with caching | Faster builds, only regenerates when content changes | @matsu |
| 2024-04-08 | Use starwind components for styling whenever possible | Consistent component style and reduced duplication | @matsu |
| 2024-04-08 | New component demos will be placed under the demo index.astro page | Centralized component demos for easier testing and discovery | @matsu |
