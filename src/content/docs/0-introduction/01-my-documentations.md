Welcome to my personal documentation vault. This section serves as a comprehensive, evolving reference for my web development workflow, tools, and best practices.

While primarily created for my own use — to maintain consistency across projects, refine my processes, and document solutions to problems I've encountered — I'm sharing it publicly. My hope is that these notes, systems, and documented experiences might offer insights or help others navigating similar challenges in their own learning and development journeys.

> [!summary] TLDR
> A curated collection of my workflows, technical notes, and documented solutions gathered throughout my career, shared transparently to help others and reinforce my own understanding.


## What You'll Find Here

Within this documentation, you'll find notes covering various aspects of my work and learning:

- **Workflows & Processes:** Guides on the systems and steps followed for development tasks and general productivity.
    
- **Tools & Technologies:** Specific configurations, tips, and reference materials for the various tools, frameworks, and technologies I use regularly (e.g., Code editors, Operating Systems like Linux/Ubuntu, Version Control Systems, Package Managers, Build Tools, etc.).
    
- **Technical References:** Organized notes on specific code patterns, solutions, and concepts by technology or problem domain.
    
- **Miscellaneous:** General notes, guides, recipes, and bookmarks/resources I find valuable or am currently exploring.

## How I Build This

This online documentation project was initiated while building my blog using Astro.js where I successfully implemented rendering my notes straight from note system. I saw the potential and value in sharing these resources online.

My documentation system has evolved over time, progressing from simple files and folders to tools like Evernote and Joplin, before settling on Obsidian as my primary vault since 2023.

Within this process, AI usage plays a significant role. I leverage AI tools extensively for learning new concepts, and critically reviewing my writing before publishing.

This is a living system that reflects my continuous learning process, capturing insights from readings, experiments, and daily work. Sharing it online is part of solidifying my understanding and contributing back to the community.

## How to Use This Documentation
