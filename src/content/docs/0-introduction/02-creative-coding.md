# My Creative Coding

## Artist Statement

My creative practice explores the intersection of coding, generative art, and mathematics. Initially out from wanting to practice my coding skills, and find generative visuals and algorithms that inspires and pique my curiosity. I create simple sketches of dynamic, evolving visual compositions that bridge technology and art. Inspired by mathematical principles like fractals, geometry, and the golden ratio, I aim to express my curiosity about patterns and structures that shape our reality.

Another key aspect of m work is bringing digital creations into the physical world. Using pen plotters, it brings the perfect generated visual of bytes into tangible, hand-drawn artifacts. Each piece is a unique iteration of my code and practice, and capturing a moment in time, space and happy accident.

My art is a form of self-expression and exploration. It allows me to engage with the world and share my fascination with the connections between art, codes, and technology that was rarely able through the practical web development. Beside pleasing my personal curiosity and creativity,  I hope to share and inspire others to see a different kind of beauty that emerges when these disciplines converge.

## My setup on keeping the process simple and maintainable

1. p5.js
2. canvas-sketch-everything/2502/250220-Creative Expression & Art Hobbies#Canvas API ( 250113-canvas-sketch – Generative Art Toolkit for JavaScript canvas-sketch.js ) & Sketches
3. penplotter (iDraw 2.0 A4)

## Generative Art

- [241116] Need to make it bite-size with notes, single-canvas spread would make it unwieldy to revisit after a long period of time.
- [ ] Create an artwork/design that could generative limitless pieces for penplotting.
	- draw out physical artwork from generative art
