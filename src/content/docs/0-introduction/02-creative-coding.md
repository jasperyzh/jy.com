## My Creative Coding

My creative practice explores the intersection of coding, generative art, designs principles, and mathematics.

My interest was initially sparkled by desire to practice coding, which led me to discovered the hypnotic generative visuals and algorithms that inspires and pique my curiosity. I create dynamic, evolving visual compositions that bridge technology and art. Inspired by graphic design principles like composition, geometry, the golden ratio, I aim to express my curiosity about patterns and structures that shape our reality.

Another key aspect of my work is bringing digital creations into the physical world. Using pen plotters, I translate the precise digital designs generated from my code into tangible, hand-drawn artifacts. Each piece is a unique iteration of my code and practice, capturing a moment in time and space, often incorporating elements of expected 'happy accident'. I find a unique sense of accomplishment in this physical process, seeing the digital translate through machine and pen onto paper.

My art is a form of self-expression and exploration. It allows me to engage with the world and share my fascination with the connections between art, codes, and technology that I was rarely able to explore through practical web development. Besides pleasing my personal curiosity and creativity,  I hope to share and inspire others to see a different kind of beauty that emerges when these disciplines converge.
