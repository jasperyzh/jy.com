# Mindset
- [[250407-Get strong at any age - 10 minutes, 3 times a week]] - 70yo can do it!
	1. Simplicity over hype, low cost, minimal equipment
	2. Minimal Time Commitment: 3 times per week / 30min per sessions
	3. consistency and habit building
	4. train to failure + overload
	5. frequency and consistency matter!
	6. balancing workouts with life
# Goal: 20 / 80, Recreation
-> [[241230-Chapter 6. Population Considerations - Adapting Training for Different Groups|Population Considerations - Adapting Training for Different Groups]] - Tailored routines improve safety, prevent injuries, and enhance progression by addressing individual recovery capacities, goals, and limitations.
# Building Muscles / Mechanical Tension

1. [[250416-Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Calisthenics CAN Build Significant Muscle|Mechanical tension is the key stimulus for muscle growth.]]
2. [[250416-Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Nutrition is Non-Negotiable (Calorie Surplus)]] - calories surplus to build muscle
# Strength Training / Calisthenics
1. [[250416-Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Prioritize High Volume & Intensity (Near Failure)|Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Prioritize High Volume & Intensity (Near Failure)]]
2. Compound Exercises & Movements
	- [[250416-Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Prioritize High Volume & Intensity (Near Failure)|Compound Movements (Push-ups, Pull-ups, Dips, Rows)]] - Often best targeted in the 6-15 rep range.
	- [[250416-Building Muscle with Calisthenics#Sufficient Sets & Rest|Sufficient Sets & Rest]] - 3-5 challenging sets / compound; rest 3-5mins between set
3. [[241230-Chapter 9. Strength Work - Optimizing Full-Body Strength#ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways - Strength Work|Strength Work]]: Routine, Rest/Recovery, Tempo/Technique, Core/Compression

# [[241230-Chapter 4. Structural Balance - Essential for Injury-Free Strength|Shoulder Health & Structural Balance]]
- balanced training prevents instability and injuries
- Combine pushing (dips, push-ups) with pulling (rows, pull-ups) for joint health.
- Handstands -> overhead strength
- L-sits strengthen scapular retractors + external rotators
- minimize need for extra accessory work.
# Cardio
# Mobility
# [[241230-Chapter 8. Warm-Up and Skill Work - Foundations for Effective Training#Chapter 8. Warm-Up and Skill Work - Foundations for Effective Training|Warm-up]]
- tailored to your mobility and fitness level
- practice skill work regularly: focus on form and balance
- 3 core components: blood flow -> mobility -> positional drills
- ~15 min
- if basic exercises gets easier, integrate into warm-ups
# [[241230-Chapter 8. Warm-Up and Skill Work - Foundations for Effective Training#Chapter 8. Warm-Up and Skill Work - Foundations for Effective Training|Skill Work]]
- after warm-up, before strength training to maximize focus
- balance & coordination (handstands, L-sits)
- Quality > Quantity
- Progression Strategy; reassess skills every 5-6 weeks, align goals

# Rest is Important / also SLEEP!
- [[250218-Train to Gain Energy & Avoid Brain Fog#**4. Avoiding Overtraining Leave the Gym with Energy Left**|Avoiding Overtraining Leave the Gym with Energy Left]] - 5 minutes rests between sets


# [[241230-Chapter 7. Constructing Your Workout Routine - Frequency in Full-Body and Split Routines#ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways - Structuring Workouts|structuring workout]]
1. full-body routines
2. split routines for specific goals
3. reassess routines 5-6 weeks
- Handstands and manna progressions are essential for shoulder health and strength.
- Include **press handstands, rope climbs, and lever work** to improve shoulder stability.
- Maintain **equal push/pull volume** with vertical and horizontal variations.
# [[241230-Chapter 5. Intro to Programming, Attributes, and Routine Design - Essentials|Programming Fundamentals]]
- organizing workouts to achieve progressive overload and goals: strength, hypertrophy, skill development, flexibility/mobility, injury prevention
- Attribute Training
	- **Strength**: Low reps, high intensity.
	- **Hypertrophy**: Moderate reps, near failure.
	- **Endurance**: High reps, low intensity, shorter rests.
	- **Mobility/Flexibility**: Can often be trained daily.
- key factors:
	- intensity (difficulty)
	- volume (sets/reps)
	- frequency (training days)
	- manage recovery, fitness, fatigue.
- structure routine
	- warm-ups
	- skill work
	- strength training
	- cool-downs
