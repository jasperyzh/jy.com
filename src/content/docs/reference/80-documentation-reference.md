# Documentation Reference

- [ ] Find a easy way to create documentation via obsidian.md, then host it online (just blog it)
      includes
		- best cheatsheets
		- best tips, hints, advice I came across

### References

- [Starlight - Astro.js powered documentation framework](https://starlight.astro.build/) â€“ used this as a jump-off point to build my simple documentation framework, opt to use my blog website instead of creating another project for this. Also synced the documentation files with Obsidian.md.
