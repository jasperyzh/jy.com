### Phaser3/4

-> [[250326-Game Development Learning Plan]]
- phaser3/4 (HTML5 game framework)
	- **Understand game pipelines, animation implementation, and scripting**—but in a **web-friendly, lightweight environment**.  
- Learn **Phaser’s core architecture** (scenes, physics, assets, input).  
- Understand **JavaScript/TypeScript game logic** (instead of Blueprints).  
- Implement **animation states** (using Phaser’s animation system or Spine/DragonBones for 2D skeletal animation).  
- Explore **UI design** (Phaser’s DOM/Canvas UI options).  
- Learn **camera controls** (zooming, following, viewport adjustments).  


- [ ] Complete a **simple browser-based game/showcase** with:  
	- **Fixed/zoomable camera**.  
	- **Character movement & animation blending**.  
	- **Playable actions** (emotes, attack combos, sit/stand states).  
	- **UI feedback** (emote icons, health bars, etc.).  

- Start with **Phaser’s official examples/tutorials** (phaser.io).  
- Dive into **Phaser-specific topics**:  
    - Loading assets (sprites, animations).  
    - Game physics (arcade, matter.js).  
    - Scene management (switching levels/menus).  
- **Hands-On Approach:**  
  - **Start a mini-game immediately** (avoid tutorial paralysis).  
  - Use **free assets** (OpenGameArt, itch.io) or placeholder graphics.  
  - Later, replace with **custom animations** (Blender/Spine for 2D skeletal rigs).  
**Break-down & Improve on: Dinosour Run**
- successfully created with huggingface+deepseek_v3
- next step, break-down into phaser's core architecture
