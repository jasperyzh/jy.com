## Step 1: User Flow - Mapping the Journey

So, the first thing is all about understanding what the user wants to do on your site. It's like drawing a map for their journey. Pretty neat, right?

## Step 2: Wireframing - Sketching the Blueprint

Next up, we sketch out the pages or screens. It's like building a house; you need a blueprint first. Tools like Figma or Balsamiq? They're your best friends here.

Using the diagram to point out where it user would flow. For UX, keep it simple stupid.

## Step 3: Design System - Picking the Paint and Wallpaper

Colors, fonts, buttons - this step is all about making things look good and consistent. I played around with real-time colors, and it's a game-changer!

## Step 4: Actual Designing - Time to Build

Now, this is where the fun begins. You've got all your pieces, and it's time to put them together. Keep it simple, make it look good, and don't be afraid to try different things.

Want to add some flair? Graphics and illustrations are the way to go. I found tools like Figma and Spline super handy for this.
