## The Journey of Refinement: Months Spent in Streamlining

/blog was previously swamped with an ever-growing list of aspirational projects, causing it to lose its original focus. The constant addition of new features only served to increase the clutter, rather than enhance the user experience.

This epiphany led me to partition the project into distinct folders or platforms. Such a decision was a breath of fresh air, lifting a considerable burden off my shoulders. It solved the overwhelming task of managing multiple projects co-existing in one space.

My p5js sketches found a new home on the dedicated editor provided on the p5js.org website. I migrated all my experimental work to Stackblitz, effectively creating an additional repository, namely /exp2.

The restructure led to a more organized approach:

- /blog and /portfolio are now partners in showcasing my work.
- /exp is dedicated to experimental designs and standards.
- /p5js solely contains the sketches from editor.p5js.org.

This well-defined division not only aids in better organization but also provides an enhanced user experience by maintaining specific focus areas. By investing time into decluttering, I've managed to unlock the full potential of tools such as Figma, a journey I look forward to sharing with you.
