Premature optimization is often considered the root of all evil in programming. But when should you actually optimize your code? This blog post, based on the insightful video by CodeAesthetic, discusses the balance between performance, velocity, and adaptability in code optimization.

## The Trade-off Triangle

When it comes to code optimization, there's a trade-off triangle between velocity (how quickly you add new features), adaptability (how well the system can change to new requirements), and performance.

Focusing on velocity means hacking together something as fast as possible, often creating technical debt that will slow you down in the long run. On the other hand, focusing on adaptability means writing code in a way that enables changes as new requirements come in. This could involve creating reusable, extensible components and beautifully crafted interfaces. However, if you make things too adaptable, you also hurt velocity and performance.

## Performance: Not the First Problem

Performance is a problem, but it's not usually the first problem. It's important to be deliberate about which way you're leaning in the trade-off triangle. For instance, a feature-complete game pushing its final ship date would focus on performance, while a game earlier in development might focus on getting more features out quickly or building up an extensible system.

## The Cost of Premature Optimization

Premature optimization usually occurs for micro performance. This is typically where someone comments in a code review that you should do X instead of Y because X is faster than Y. But computers are really fast, and getting to the solution of a real-world problem faster is usually better than solving the problem slower with faster code.

## The Importance of Measuring

The key to proper optimization is measuring. Your assumptions of what will make things faster can actually make things slower. Data structure selection is by far the most important aspect of performance issues, as choosing the right data structure can give dramatically better results over the wrong one.

## Profiling: Finding the Hot Spots

When dealing with performance issues, a profiler can tell you what the hot spots of your code are. It can point out the functions that are the most expensive. Sometimes, when things are slow, it's just one silly thing slowing everything down.

## Conclusion

When you optimize, first have a real performance problem, then measure it. Try to make 80% moves by swapping data structures or moving to a well-known faster algorithm. Profile and find hot spots. Then, worst case, start thinking about what your code is doing under the hood.
