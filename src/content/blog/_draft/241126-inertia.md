# Inertia | Keep Going, Keep Rolling

> [!summary] **TL;DR:** Like "Keep it stupid, simple" with an extra steps to
> identify the important stuff.

The concept of "Keep it Simple, Essential" is a variation of the KISS principle,
which stands for "Keep it simple, stupid."

K.I.S.S. is a design and problem-solving concept that prioritizes simplicity.
I've known since college days, echoing the idea that "less is more" that
prevalent in the design school.

It is valuable for keeping things straightforward and user-friendly, but what if
the subject itself is inherently cluttered or unnecessary? Simplifying something
ineffective won’t make it useful. That’s where Keep it Simple, Essential comes
in: going beyond simplicity to find and focus on the essence of what truly
matters.

1. **Identify the Core Purpose or Goal**
2. **List Everything Down**
3. **Evaluate Each Element's Value and Relevance**
4. **Declutter Non-essentials** (only keep what sparks joy)
5. **Optimize What's Left**
6. **Regularly Reassess and Refine**

By emphasizing the essentials, this method allows room for complexity while
keeping the focus on what's important. Personally, I find this approach more
efficient, and provides clarity from the start and helps me avoid wasting time
and resources in non-essential tasks.

## How I came to this

Over the past few years, I’ve explored various areas and concepts, but my
experience with magfed paintball taught me the most about simplicity and
essentials. In magfed game, you’re limited by what you can carry |paintball
masks, a paintball marker (gun) with magazines that hold a fixed number of
paintballs, and other gear.

With only a limited number of shots, you need to be efficient. Amidst the sweat,
panic, and adrenaline, it taught you to stay calm under pressure. You quickly
realize that carrying less weight not only makes you more mobile but also
improves your ability to strategize and adapt.

By minimizing gear, I could move more freely, sneaking up on opponents and even
performing the occasional impractical acrobatic "tacticool" roll to live out my
action fantasies! These experiences shaped my approach to life: my mindset has
become more pragmatic, and I prioritize durability, efficiency, and minimalism.
I aim for simplicity and function in everything I carry, and over time, I’ve
gravitated toward Minimalism and Zen philosophy, which both emphasize clarity
and order.

## Conclusion

_"The art of less is not subtraction but refinement. What remains is what truly
matters."_

This principle feels timeless, and I continue to apply and refine it as I go.
While the specifics may change over time, the focus on essentials remains a
constant.
