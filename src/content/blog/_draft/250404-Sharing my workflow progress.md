# My current workflow

### my learning workflow

1. my resources
2. 

### my notetaking workflow

### my web development workflow

### my meta-framework



struggling to start writing, not sure where to start
haven't really written my whole life, confident is non-existence
but i want to share this cause
1. useful for me to reflect on things, journal my process and progress
2. want to pass on these notes & knowledge to my kid
3. share knowledge to anyone that finds these useful

maybe starting is not important, slow iteration does

here goes nothing


### where i get my resources from?

1. youtube - i cannot understate the power of youtube, all the daily consumption of videos helps teaching me various subjects. few notable channel:
	- space science! – started off with scott manley's kerbal space program, and his vast knowledge of space and rocket is what got me enjoy the stories space science
	- Crash Course – world history that was hosted by John Green. accessible lessons on history without chewing through thick history book? hell yes. and decades later it still running strong with plenty of subjects to dive into
	- 
2. documentation – the dullest place on the internet, who would spend time reading manuals? no one, but developer gotta know the tools before building a hen house.
3. web surfing – here and there, blog posts and interesting discussion

tools that help with my notetaking:

- AI – cannot understate how much this help with my notetaking
- Obsidian.md – the hunt for the perfect notetaking software is over for me.
