I have spent months gather all my notes together, however now it looks intimidating to even try to clear/write what I have set out to do.

One bite at a time... to eat an elephant üêò


However I have finally come around and clean-up the template Grid that I have vibe-coded few months back. Now all it need is the Export template to make sure all the crafted shapes and lines are drawn in SVG. 


I'm building a framework for my penplotter, as current setup is pretty much one-off for each sketch, building the layout from scratch for each session is time consuming, so if I could craft out a style of template that can be reuse, that'd be great. (not to over do it of course)

While cleaning my code, I have encounter a new method on refreshing the sketch instead of old-skool way of using `boolean` to check the refresh, not sure if it unique to `canvas-sketch` but here goes!

update a little of my website documentation on about digital cleanliness, it helps immensely with my files organization in the digital realm, its a method that I have been polishing for last few years, it works on Windows and Linux too when I migrated over.

### AI Talk

Right, with Google now enabling AI Chatbot for Children under 13, opt-in by default.

Here are some helpful link that help navigate the AI for starters:

- [Google's Family Guide to AI](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/family-guide-to-ai.pdf) ‚Äì A conversation guide to help you and your family get started with AI

#### Parents Guide on navigating these?

Personal thought on this...

- sad, its inevitable
- parents are learning these at the same time as the children does
- and in my experience, children might learn even faster and deeply more than the parents
- but for now with my toddler, the most we do is just printing out generated image together
- in someway i'm grateful I still have some time before my kid starts surfing on the internet.
- so what kind of rules does parents apply to their kids when ti comes to responsible use of the internet? or free-range on the internet? üíÄ

As developer thought,

- AI wars?
- New Models and what are the differences?
- How did it helped me in my work?

Be calm that AI would not start shooting red laser out from their eyes (yet!), it actually pretty helpful in the realm of digital world, hence why you heard all the big corporations and news headline keep chanting and raving about "AI". It going to change the world, but it would not be at the instant, but at the rate the expansion and speed it going have experts concerned.

AI is really good at finding patterns, thanks to the training data we provided to them.

AI can make mistakes, "hallucinate"
