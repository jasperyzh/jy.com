Back in college, I asked my history lecturer what era we're in. 'Globalization,' she said — an age defined by advances in transports and communication, where trade connected the world like never before. It gave us cheap goods, smartphones in our pockets, and constant exchange of ideas, cultures, and beliefs. Back then, I thought it had always been this way, since I was born into world of abundance.

But now with harsh tariffs and growing unwillingness to cooperate, are we entering an era of de-globalization, AI-driven utopia/dystopia, or something else entirely?
