Disabling right-click on your website can be achieved with a simple JavaScript code snippet. By intercepting the right-click event, you can stop it from triggering the default browser context menu. Let's look at how this can be done:

```
<script>
document.addEventListener("contextmenu", function(event){
    event.preventDefault();
}, false);
</script>
```

This snippet of code effectively bars the default right-click menu from popping up when a user right-clicks anywhere on your website. However, it's important to note that this method isn't entirely foolproof - certain users may still find ways to access the menu via alternative techniques.

Moreover, some users might find this restriction annoying or frustrating, which could potentially have a negative effect on their experience with your site. Therefore, it's crucial to weigh these potential issues against the benefits of implementing such a method.

## How to Disable Right-Click on Images Specifically?

To disable right-clicking solely on images, you can slightly modify the previous code snippet:

```
<script>
document.addEventListener("contextmenu", function(event){
    if (event.target.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'img') {
        event.preventDefault();
    }
}, false);
</script>
```

This particular code will prevent the context menu from appearing when a user right-clicks on any image element on your website, while allowing it for the other elements. Similar caveats apply to this method as well, so be mindful of the potential user experience implications.
